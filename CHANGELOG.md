## [0.31.2] - 2026-07-04

**Playability pass — acting on the July Fable full-project audit
([`docs/development/july-fable-audit.md`](docs/development/july-fable-audit.md)).** Works
down the audit's recommended fix order, each item a self-contained change. Gameplay
state-machine correctness first (the bugs that made a level unwinnable or instantly
lethal), then the one HIGH memory-safety hole and the per-frame allocator leak, then
UI/input polish. No render-path perf regression — the mixer/AI fixes are off the hot path.

### Security

- **Texture-height buffer overflow closed (audit F-S1 — HIGH).** `texture_get_column`
  bounded its column clear + patch composite by the texture's height, read straight from
  the WAD's `TEXTURE1` header (`read_le16`, 0–65535) and never clamped — but both callers
  pass a fixed 256-byte `tex_col_buf`. A WAD (any WAD accepted on the command line)
  declaring a texture height > 256 that is referenced by an on-screen wall overflowed
  that heap buffer by up to ~64 KB (zeros plus attacker-positioned patch pixels) the
  first frame it drew. Now the height is clamped to a shared `TEX_COL_MAX = 256` before
  it bounds any write, and both allocation sites reference the same constant so they
  can't drift. Latent on DOOM1.WAD (max height 128); E1M1 render is byte-identical.
  Verified with a canary test (height 4096 → zero bytes past the buffer).
  ([`src/texture.cyr`](src/texture.cyr), [`src/render.cyr`](src/render.cyr))
- **PNAMES / patch-post / PPM hardening (audit F-S3 / F-S5 / F-S6).**
  (1) `texture_init` now guards `PNAMES` with `pn_size >= 4` before reading the count and
  bounds the count by `(pn_size - 4) / 8`, so a truncated lump can't over-read past the
  allocation (F-S3). (2) The patch post-walk in `texture_get_column` now breaks on
  `post_ptr + 1 >= pdata_end`, matching the other decoders, so the length byte read stays
  in-bounds (F-S5). (3) PPM files open with `O_TRUNC | O_NOFOLLOW` added — no stale
  trailing bytes from a larger pre-existing file, and no following a symlink at the fixed
  `/tmp` paths (F-S6). ([`src/texture.cyr`](src/texture.cyr), [`src/framebuf.cyr`](src/framebuf.cyr))

### Fixed

- **Melee monsters no longer deal instant-death contact damage (audit F-G1).** In
  `thing_ai_tick`'s `STATE_CHASE` block, the "lost sight?" branch ran as a *separate*
  `if` on the same tick the monster armed its 15-tick attack wind-up, and its `else`
  (still-in-sight) path unconditionally reset `tics` to 0 — wiping the wind-up, so the
  next tick's `STATE_ATTACK` saw `tics==0` and hit immediately, looping every ~2 ticks
  (~245 DPS, sub-second death on any melee touch). Restructured to compute
  `thing_check_sight` once per tick and gate the attack-transition vs. give-up-timer
  reset through a single `if/else` so the wind-up survives. Also removes two redundant
  `thing_check_sight` calls per chasing monster per tick. ([`src/things.cyr`](src/things.cyr))
  Regression test added (`combat: melee wind-up`) — WAD-free suite 63 → 69 asserts,
  full 101 → 107.
- **Sprite renderer no longer leaks 16 KB per frame (audit F-S2).** `sprite_render_all`
  called `alloc(16384)` for its patch buffer every frame — ~560 KB/s at 35 Hz on the
  never-free bump allocator, unbounded RSS growth over a long session. Hoisted to a
  file-scope `spr_patch_buf` with the standard lazy-init guard (matching
  `weapon_patch_buf` / `_spr_prefix`); allocated once, reused thereafter. Render output
  is byte-identical. ([`src/sprite.cyr`](src/sprite.cyr))
- **PPM writer no longer leaks a row buffer per frame (audit F-S4).** `framebuf_write_ppm`
  allocated its 960-byte row buffer on every call — a steady leak in the GTK-bridge path
  that writes a PPM each frame. Hoisted to a lazily-initialised `ppm_row_buf`.
  ([`src/framebuf.cyr`](src/framebuf.cyr))
- **Doors and lifts are repeatable again — one-shot-per-map soft-lock fixed (audit
  F-G2).** `doors_tick` had no handler for the terminal `DS_CLOSED` state and never
  released a completed thinker, so a finished door/lift sat in the array forever bound
  to its sector; `door_open`/`lift_activate` then bailed on `door_find_sector`, so the
  door could never reopen and the lift could never be re-ridden (and the array capped at
  `DOOR_MAX = 32` lifetime activations). Now terminal states call `door_free` (sector :=
  -1) and a new `door_alloc_slot` reclaims freed slots, so doors/lifts re-trigger
  normally and the pool no longer exhausts. `doors_tick`'s `switch` — flagged by the
  audit as latent cycc return-smash risk — is rewritten as the codebase's standard flat
  `if (state == …)` ladder over a state snapshot. ([`src/doors.cyr`](src/doors.cyr))
- **"Open and stay open" doors latch instead of auto-closing (audit F-G3).** D1/W1/S1
  specials (2, 31, 103) funnelled through the generic open-wait-close path, so a door
  meant to stay open (and be unreopenable) instead shut after ~3 s and — with F-G2 —
  sealed permanently, potentially trapping the player. Added a `DS_OPENING_STAY` state
  and `door_open_stay`; those specials now raise once and latch (releasing their slot at
  the top). ([`src/doors.cyr`](src/doors.cyr))
- **Chasing monsters no longer phase through walls (audit F-G4).** `STATE_CHASE` set the
  monster's x/y directly with zero collision — monsters walked through one-sided walls,
  closed doors, and ledges into other rooms (worst during the lost-sight grace window).
  Movement now goes through the player's collision core (`player_check_position`, which
  blocks solid walls and closed doors z-independently): the monster tries the diagonal
  step, then slides along a single axis to round a corner, else holds. (Step-height still
  references the player's elevation — a small known inaccuracy, far better than none.)
  Regression coverage: a chaser still closes distance on open ground (`72` WAD-free
  asserts). ([`src/things.cyr`](src/things.cyr))
- **Spent barrels stop shielding the monster behind them (audit F-G5).** A detonated
  barrel kept `TF_SHOOTABLE` forever — its `STATE_DIE → STATE_DEAD` transition lived only
  in the monster-only AI path (`thing_ai_tick` early-returned for decorations), so it
  froze on a death frame as a permanent bullet-shield that silently absorbed every shot
  fired across it. Now `thing_damage` drops shootable/solid the instant a barrel blows,
  and `thing_ai_tick` advances a dying decoration to an inert `TF_CORPSE`. Regression
  test fires through a spent barrel into the monster behind it. ([`src/things.cyr`](src/things.cyr))
- **Inventory carries across level transitions (audit F-G6).** `load_map` unconditionally
  called `player_init`, which reset health/armor/weapons/ammo to pistol start — so the
  shotgun found in E1M1 was gone at the start of E1M2. Split off `player_spawn_at_start`
  (reposition only) from `player_init` (full reset); `load_map` now takes a `reset_player`
  flag — `1` for a new game / death-respawn (full reset, unchanged), `0` for a level
  advance (keep health/armor/weapons/ammo, reposition, clear the per-level keys).
  ([`src/player.cyr`](src/player.cyr), [`src/main.cyr`](src/main.cyr))
- **Intermission and death screens no longer self-dismiss; TAB no longer flickers the
  automap (audit F-U3 / F-U4).** All three read `input_flags`, which is level-triggered
  (held keys, tty autorepeat, AGNOS persistent key-state) — so a level exited or a death
  taken with a movement key held flashed the screen for ~28 ms, and holding TAB toggled
  the automap at 35 Hz. The two wait loops now edge-detect a *fresh* press (wait for all
  keys to release, then a new press), and the automap toggle latches on a 0→1 TAB
  transition. Runtime-verified: one TAB press = exactly one toggle.
  ([`src/main.cyr`](src/main.cyr), [`src/level.cyr`](src/level.cyr))
- **"New Game" reaches the skill screen instead of instant-starting (audit F-U1).** The
  menu's use handler ran sequential `if (menu_screen == …)` branches, so selecting New
  Game (which sets `menu_screen = MENU_SKILL`) fell straight through the MENU_SKILL branch
  in the same call and started the game at the default skill — the skill screen was
  unreachable. The handler now snapshots the screen before dispatching. Runtime-verified:
  New Game now lands on the skill screen (no game start). ([`src/menu.cyr`](src/menu.cyr))
- **Skill selection actually changes the monster set (audit F-U2).** The THINGS options
  word (skill bits + multiplayer flag) was stored but never read, so every skill spawned
  the Ultra-Violence set and multiplayer-only things leaked into single-player.
  `things_spawn_from_map` now filters on the selected `game_skill` (skill 1&2 → bit 0x01,
  3 → 0x02, 4&5 → 0x04) and drops multiplayer-only things (0x10), matching vanilla
  `P_SpawnMapThing`. The chosen skill is recorded from the menu (default HMP when the menu
  is skipped, e.g. direct-map CLI). Because the initial `load_map` runs before `menu_run`,
  the interactive path re-spawns the first level's things after the menu returns so the
  selected difficulty applies to E1M1 too (not just from the first level-advance onward).
  Verified on E1M1: skill 1 → 4, skill 3 → 6, skill 5 → 29 monsters (previously a flat 29
  on every skill; and menu-selecting Nightmare now re-spawns E1M1 at 29). ([`src/things.cyr`](src/things.cyr),
  [`src/map.cyr`](src/map.cyr), [`src/menu.cyr`](src/menu.cyr), [`src/main.cyr`](src/main.cyr))
- **Sprite rotation was 180° off — monsters showed their backs while approaching (audit
  F-R1).** `sprite_calc_rotation` omitted the ANG180 term, so `rel` (view→thing minus the
  thing's facing) picked the opposite of the correct sprite view: a monster facing you
  resolved to rotation 5 (its back). Added the ANG180 term. Regression test pins
  facing-viewer → front (rot 1), facing-away → back (rot 5), left-side → rot 3.
  `render_frame` **2.858 ms** (variance-level; the rotation calc is off the pixel loop).
  ([`src/sprite.cyr`](src/sprite.cyr))
- **Linux input hardening (audit F-U5 / F-U9 / F-U10).** (F-U5) The tty decoder now
  handles a CSI escape sequence as a unit: it scans `ESC [ … <final>` to the final byte
  and acts only on that, so a modified arrow (`ESC [ 1 ; 2 C`) no longer leaks its `1`/`2`
  into the weapon-select scan, and a sequence split across a full 32-byte read is consumed
  rather than mis-read as a quit (a bare arrow and Shift+arrow both resolve to the arrow;
  a lone ESC still quits). Runtime-verified: arrows still turn, no spurious quit/weapon
  swap. (F-U9) Uppercase `E`/`F`/`Q` are now aliased to use/fire/quit, so Caps Lock no
  longer disables them. (F-U10) The direct-map arg is validated (`strlen >= 4` and `'M'` at
  index 2) before indexing, closing the OOB read on a short arg and rejecting malformed
  forms like `E1X3`; two `sakshi_info` length arguments were off by one (banner 43→42,
  audio-test 31→32). ([`src/input.cyr`](src/input.cyr), [`src/main.cyr`](src/main.cyr))
- **PC-speaker tone lifecycle + audio pumping in wait loops (audit F-U7).** `sound_tick`
  started a queued tone and counted it down in the *same* call, so every 1-tick tone (the
  dry-fire click, plasma, menu-move) was turned on and off within microseconds and never
  played — fixed with a `just_started` guard. The death-wait loop pumped `audio_tick` but
  not `sound_tick` (a tone mid-playback at death left the speaker beeping); the
  intermission loop pumped neither (AGNOS ring underrun → stale-content echo). Both wait
  loops (and the menu loop) now pump `sound_tick` — and the intermission also pumps
  `audio_tick`. ([`src/sound.cyr`](src/sound.cyr), [`src/main.cyr`](src/main.cyr),
  [`src/level.cyr`](src/level.cyr), [`src/menu.cyr`](src/menu.cyr))


**DOOM audio IRON-VALIDATED on archaemenid — "ALL DOOM SOUNDS PERFECT."** The 0.31.0 audio
retarget shipped, but the first iron burns had a residual echo/dropout that a long chase
(deeper adaptive buffer, log removal, DMX-pad skip, an LPIB-rate experiment) only mitigated
— because **the real root cause was in agnos, not doom**: the kernel's LAPIC timer was
uncalibrated and ran ~12× slow on real Zen (a hardcoded QEMU-tuned reload count), so the
100 Hz HDA servicer couldn't keep the 48 kHz ring fed. **Fixed kernel-side in agnos 1.52.8**
(boot-time LAPIC calibration). With a correct system clock, doom's audio is clean on iron.

### Changed
- **Restored the per-SFX `sakshi_info` logs in `--audio-test`** (`main.cyr`). They were removed
  mid-chase on a wrong theory that the console-render stall caused the glitch; with the timer
  fixed they cost nothing (Linux plays fine with the same logs — so agnos does too). The 8
  `sfx: pistol` / `shotgun` / … lines are back, marking each SFX as it fires.
- **Skip the DMX 16-sample lead/tail pad in `audio_load`** (Chocolate/PrBoom parity) — removes
  ~1.5 ms of "empty air" before each SFX. Harmless correctness win.

### Removed
- The temporary FB fill-vs-tick **graph telemetry + 12 s hold** from `--audio-test`, and the
  `audio_fill_hist`/`audio_fill_idx` DBG state from `audio.cyr`. They were the diagnostic that
  helped localize the timer bug; no longer needed.

### Notes
- The agnos-side adaptive producer (`audio_tick` reads `sys_snd_avail` and fills to
  `AUDIO_AGNOS_TARGET`) stays — proper flow control. The target is currently **12288 frames
  (~256 ms)**, deepened during the chase to mask the slow clock; now that the clock is fixed it
  is conservative and **can be trimmed toward ~60–90 ms for snappier in-game SFX latency** (a
  follow-up, gated on an iron listen). Kept deep here because it is the known-good state.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-04

**Sound on agnos — DOOM SFX out the sovereign HDA output (the audio arc's Gate 4).**
Retargets the digital-SFX output stage onto the agnos `sys_snd_*` syscall band (`#64–#69`,
frozen in agnos 1.52.7 + shipped in the cyrius v6.4.2 stdlib), so DOOM's WAD sound effects
reach the ALC897 codec on agnos — the `cyrius-doom audio.cyr → sys_snd_* → agnos #64–#69 →
HDA ring → ALC897` path is now live.

### Changed
- **Closed-loop adaptive-`avail` producer on agnos (the echo/underrun fix).** The first iron
  burn played every SFX with a **heavy echo/repeat** + slight slowness. Root cause (measured):
  the agnos HDA ring is drained by a **free-running 48 kHz DAC** independent of the 35 Hz /
  10 ms-quantized game clock, so pushing a **fixed ~1371 frames per tick** left the ring only
  ~1 tick deep; the 100 Hz `sleep_ms` jitter (20/30 ms) then tipped it into **underrun**, where
  the cyclic BDL **replays ~28 ms of stale ring content** = the echo. (Linux is clean because
  vani→ALSA buffers ~186 ms and absorbs the jitter; the raw agnos ring has no such cushion.)
  Fix (`audio.cyr`, agnos-gated): `audio_tick` now reads **`sys_snd_avail`#69** (ground truth of
  what actually drained) and mixes+pushes chunks in a loop until the ring fill reaches a deep,
  jitter-tolerant **`AUDIO_AGNOS_TARGET` = 8192 frames (~171 ms)** (capped at 7 chunks/tick). The
  mix body is factored into `audio_mix_chunk()`; each chunk still renders exactly `MIX_SRC_SAMPLES`
  (315) so `audio_up_acc` + per-voice `cpos` advance identically — pitch/timing stay drift-free,
  and 315 samples emit ≤5488 B < `OUT_BUF_BYTES` (no overflow). The **Linux/ALSA path is byte-
  identical** (one chunk per tick behind `#ifndef`). QEMU-verified: ring fill held at the target (was
  ~1 tick, near-empty), SFX bursts **23 → 8** (echo clusters gone), no slowdown. (First iron burn:
  the rate/speed fix landed but a residual echo remained at the initial 3072/~64ms target — real
  ALC897 service stalls exceed what QEMU models — so `AUDIO_AGNOS_TARGET` was deepened to
  8192/~171ms; to be tuned down to the min-clean depth for in-game SFX latency once iron confirms.)
  No kernel change
  (a kernel silence-net was rejected — it would make the timer ISR a second `snd_appl` writer,
  breaking the lock-free single-writer band ABI).
- **`OUT_RATE` 44100 → 48000** to match the agnos HDA stream's hard-armed 48k/16/2 format
- **`OUT_RATE` 44100 → 48000** to match the agnos HDA stream's hard-armed 48k/16/2 format
  (a valid raw ALSA rate too, so the Linux path is unaffected in kind). The output stage's
  fixed ×4 integer upsample (44100/11025) becomes a **drift-free Bresenham nearest-neighbour
  upsampler** (`audio_up_acc`, `audio_tick`): each 11025 mono source sample emits
  `floor((acc+48000)/11025)` output frames (4 or 5, averaging 4.354), the accumulator carried
  across ticks so the long-run count is exactly 48000/11025 — no pitch drift. Per-tick output
  is now a variable ~1371/1372 frames (`OUT_BUF_BYTES` grown 5040 → 6400 to hold it); the push
  uses the actual produced count (`oi/4`), not a fixed constant.
- **`audio_init` / `audio_preload` / `audio_tick` agnos branches** (`#ifdef CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS`):
  `audio_init` opens the output via `sys_snd_open()` + `sys_snd_config(slot, 48000, 0x1002)`
  (S16/stereo) instead of ALSA (storing `slot+1` in `audio_dev` so 0 stays "no device"); the
  per-tick push uses `sys_snd_write_nb`; `audio_preload` now loads the WAD SFX on agnos (was a
  no-op). The vani/ALSA path (`audio_open_best`/`audio_write`/EPIPE recovery) is unchanged on
  non-agnos targets. `sound.cyr`'s PC-speaker guard stays agnos-disabled (no PC speaker there).
- **Toolchain pin → cyrius 6.4.2** (`cyrius.cyml`) — the release carrying the `sys_snd_*` peer;
  the vendored `lib/` was `cyrius lib sync --full`'d to the 6.4.2 snapshot (the stale wrappers
  lacked `sys_snd_*`). Builds clean for agnos.

### Fixed
- **`audio_init` / `audio_shutdown` agnos branches fell through to the ALSA-only tail on a fake
  handle → `#PF` inside `load_map`.** With `audio_dev = slot + 1` (a small integer, not an fd), the
  post-branch common code (`audio_set_sw_params`/`audio_prepare`/`audio_fd`/`SYS_FCNTL` in `audio_init`;
  `audio_drain`/`audio_close` in `audio_shutdown`) operated on that fake handle and faulted on agnos.
  Both agnos branches now `return` before the Linux-only tail (and `audio_shutdown` calls
  `sys_snd_drain`/`sys_snd_close` on the slot). Surfaced by the agnos `--audio-test` bring-up, where
  it masked the actual audio path; caught via serial bisection.
- **Validated end-to-end on agnos in QEMU** (agnos `scripts/doom-audio-smoke.sh`): `--audio-test`
  plays all 8 SFX out the emulated `intel-hda` and the captured wav is non-silent (PEAK=24287) — first
  cyrius-doom sound on AGNOS. (The exercise also caught + fixed an agnos kernel bug where the HDA PCM
  ring's CPU-access VA wasn't in the per-process CR3; fixed kernel-side in agnos 1.52.7.)

## [0.30.7] - 2026-06-29

**Positional/stereo SFX + Sound-menu live preview.** Builds on the 0.30.5/0.30.6
audio work: monster and explosion sounds now attenuate with distance and pan
across the stereo field, and the volume slider previews live. Binary **621,080 →
623,520 B** (+2,440; `doom_agnos` 607,680 → 610,152 B). `render_frame` **2.956 ms**
(E1M1, cycc 6.3.5 — variance-level; the mixer is off the render path). Tests
**63/63** WAD-free + **101/101** full; `fuzz_wad`/`fuzz_fixed` 1000/50000 clean;
`cyrius deps --verify` **37/0**; DCE 1001 / 294,063 B. Vetted by a 27-agent
pre-cut adversarial review (17/17 confirmed as correctness verifications — zero
defects; L/R pan direction confirmed correct, centered playback bit-identical to
0.30.6).

### Added

- **Positional SFX — distance attenuation + stereo pan** — `audio_play_at(name,
  sx, sy)` attenuates by the player→source distance (full within 160 u, linear
  to silence at 1200 u; beyond that no voice is taken) and pans by the source
  angle relative to the player's facing, using the original engine's
  approximate-distance + stereo-swing (96) panning law. The mixer is now truly
  stereo (per-voice `lvol`/`rvol`, separate L/R accumulators). Wired at the
  monster **death**/**pain** and **explosion** sites (`things.cyr`); player-,
  pickup- and door-sourced sounds stay centered. **A centered, full-volume voice
  is bit-identical to the 0.30.6 mono mix.**
- **Sound-menu live preview** — adjusting the SFX slider plays a pistol shot at
  the new level (the device is already open before the menu), so you can hear the
  volume as you set it. `audio_tick` is pumped in the `menu_run` loop.
- **`--audio-test` LEFT/RIGHT pan pings** — two positional pistol shots 400 u to
  the player's left and right, so the stereo pan can be verified headless without
  launching gameplay (now 8 sounds over ~8 s).

### Changed

- **Sound-menu polish** (0.30.6 review nice-to-haves) — defensive `[0, 15]` clamp
  inside `menu_draw_thermo`; the slider's increment is `else`-gated so a held key
  steps cleanly.

**SFX volume control + Options→Sound menu, plus ALSA hardening and a bsp bump.**
Builds on the 0.30.5 audio revive: the previously display-only "Sound Volume"
option is now a live menu, and two robustness gaps from the 0.30.5 pre-cut review
are closed. Binary **619,224 → 621,080 B** (+1,856; `doom_agnos` 605,808 →
607,680 B). `render_frame` **2.950 ms** (E1M1, cycc 6.3.5 — variance-level; none
of this touches the render path). Tests **63/63** WAD-free + **101/101** full;
`fuzz_wad`/`fuzz_fixed` 1000/50000 clean; `cyrius deps --verify` **37/0**. Vetted
by a 29-agent pre-cut adversarial review (20/20 findings confirmed as correctness
verifications — zero defects).

### Added

- **Master SFX volume + Options→Sound menu** — selecting "Sound Volume" on the
  Options screen now opens a real Sound sub-menu (`MENU_SOUND`) with a DOOM-style
  thermometer slider (`M_THERML`/`M_THERMM`/`M_THERMR` track + `M_THERMO` knob).
  Left/right (arrows or A/D, debounced) adjust `sfx_volume` (0–15), applied as a
  gain in the `audio_tick` mix stage: `asr((sample<<8)*(vol+1), 4)` — so **v=15
  is bit-identical full scale** (default, unchanged from 0.30.5) and **v=0 mutes**.
  `--ppm-menu` gained a Sound-screen render.

### Changed

- **`[deps.bsp]` `1.1.5` → `1.2.0`** — source-module bump (no ABI surface change);
  `cyrius.lock` regenerated (`rm -rf lib && cyrius deps`), verifies **37/0** with
  only the bsp row moved (transitive trio + stdlib leaves unchanged). Both Linux
  and `--agnos` link clean; 63/63 + 101/101 hold.

### Fixed

- **ALSA suspend/resume recovery** — `audio_tick` now also recovers from
  `-ESTRPIPE` (PCM suspended on system sleep) via `audio_resume` + `audio_prepare`,
  alongside the existing `-EPIPE` underrun path. `-EAGAIN`/short writes still fall
  through untouched (the never-stall design).
- **HW_PARAMS-fallback start-threshold** — `audio_set_sw_params(MIX_START, …)` is
  now applied **only** when the explicit period/buffer were accepted
  (`audio_explicit_params`). On the kernel-chosen-buffer fallback a fixed
  `start_threshold` could exceed a smaller negotiated buffer and never auto-start
  (total silence); the fallback now leaves the kernel default (`start_threshold=1`).

**Audio revive — DOOM SFX actually play through ALSA now.** The `audio.cyr` +
vani path was wired but **dead**: `audio_play` had zero callers, so not one `DS*`
sample ever reached the card — all in-game sound came from the PC-speaker beep
fallback (`sound.cyr`), inaudible on hardware without a `pcspkr`. This cut makes
the real WAD sounds play, fixing every blocker found by reproducing on metal.
Binary **613,720 → 619,224 B** (+5,504, the software mixer + device pick + the
`--audio-test` harness; `doom_agnos` 600,272 → 605,808 B). `render_frame`
**3.082 ms** (E1M1, cycc 6.3.5 — variance-level; the mixer is not on the render
path and no-ops when no card is present). Tests **63/63** WAD-free + **101/101**
full; `fuzz_wad`/`fuzz_fixed` 1000/50000 clean; DCE **998 unreachable / 295,193 B**;
`cyrius deps --verify` **37/0**. Vetted by a 29-agent pre-cut adversarial review
(18 findings confirmed; the one HIGH — an AGNOS null-page write — fixed below;
MED/LOW deferred to the roadmap audio-hardening item).

### Added

- **Software SFX mixer** (`src/audio.cyr`) — 8-voice, non-blocking. Voices are
  cached + mixed at DOOM-native 11025 mono (U8); `audio_tick()` (driven once per
  35 Hz tick from the game loop + dead-wait loop) renders one tick of audio and
  pushes it with a non-blocking `WRITEI` so it can never stall the frame loop.
  Underruns (`-EPIPE`) self-heal via re-`prepare`. Voice allocation prefers a
  free slot, else steals the one with the least audio remaining.
- **`--audio-test` mode** (`src/main.cyr`) — plays six real DOOM SFX paced at
  35 Hz, no framebuffer required, so the output chain (device pick, format
  conversion, non-blocking writes) can be verified directly on the speaker/jack.
- **Real WAD sounds wired to game events** (`player`/`things`/`doors.cyr`,
  alongside the kept PC-speaker fallback): weapon fire (`DSPISTOL`/`DSSHOTGN`/
  `DSRLAUNC`/`DSPLASMA`), player + monster pain/death, item pickup, door,
  explosion. All pre-cached by `audio_preload` so the first hit does no
  mid-frame WAD I/O.

### Fixed

- **Audio output was entirely dead** — `audio_play`/`audio_play_name` had no
  callers; now driven from the `sound_*` event sites.
- **Wrong sound card** — the hardcoded `audio_open_playback(0, 0)` opened card 0
  device 0, which on a box with a GPU is the HDMI codec (and often has no D0
  node at all → "no device"). New `audio_open_best()` prefers the **analog**
  card (its device 0 has a capture sibling; HDMI is playback-only), falling back
  to the first playback node that accepts the format.
- **Impossible format** — requested S8/mono/11025, which real HDA codecs reject
  outright (the analog jack accepts **only S16_LE/stereo/44100·48000**). The raw
  hw node does no conversion, so the mixer's output stage now converts: U8→S16
  (`(s<<8)`), mono→L/R, and a clean **4× upsample** (44100/11025 = 4 exactly).
  315 mono samples in → 1260 stereo frames out per tick, exact (no drift). Honest
  logging: only `audio: ALSA playback` on a config the device actually accepted.
- **Audio died after the first level transition** — `audio_init()` runs in
  `load_map()` (every map); the old code re-opened the **exclusive** PCM node
  while the prior fd was held → `-EBUSY`. Now idempotent via a one-shot
  `audio_inited` flag; `audio_shutdown()` wired at exit.
- **AGNOS null-page write** (pre-cut review, HIGH) — on AGNOS `audio_init`
  early-returns before allocating the caches, but the event sites still call
  `audio_load`; the first SFX did `store64(0 + idx*8, …)`. `audio_load` now
  no-ops when `snd_cache_lumps == 0`. Plus an AGNOS `#ifdef` guard on
  `audio_init`/`audio_preload` (mirrors `sound.cyr`).
- **Malformed `DS*` lumps** — validate the DMX format word (== 3) and reject
  `nsamples <= 0` (and the post-decimation 1-sample-22050 `alloc(0)` case);
  decimate the one 22050 Hz shareware lump (`DSITMBK`) 2:1 to the device rate.

### Known limitations (→ roadmap audio-hardening item)

- Output is hardcoded **S16/stereo/44100**; cards that reject 44100 (need 48000)
  aren't handled yet (fractional resample). HW_PARAMS-fallback path keeps the
  fixed start-threshold (could mis-start on an unusually small negotiated
  buffer). Only `-EPIPE` is recovered (not suspend/resume). SFX play at the
  lump's native loudness (no normalization/volume) — soft lumps like `DSITEMUP`
  (±19 vs gunfire's ±128) are faithfully quiet. PC-speaker + ALSA both fire per
  event. Device heuristic can't tell a virtual card (snd-aloop) from the codec.

## [0.30.4] - 2026-06-29

Toolchain + dependency bump to the cyrius 6.3.x line. No application logic
changes — the only `src/` edit is the version banner. Binary **612,672 →
613,720 B** (+1,048, 6.3.0/6.3.5 codegen growth-tax; `doom_agnos` 592,448 →
600,272 B). `render_frame` **2.971 ms** (E1M1, cycc 6.3.5 — variance-level vs
0.30.1's 2.957 ms). Tests **63/63** WAD-free + **101/101** full;
`fuzz_fixed`/`fuzz_wad`/`fuzz_weapon` 50000/1000/2000 clean.

### Changed

- **`cyrius` pin `6.2.44` → `6.3.5`** (`cyrius.cyml`) — closes the launcher
  drift (cycc already ran 6.3.5; the manifest now matches). The band carries two
  default-codegen deltas, both re-verified green: 6.3.5 CO-01 (forward-call ABI
  fix, exercises the `Result<T,E>` WAD path) and 6.3.0 (per-var `_base`
  indirection; `fuzz_fixed` + render bench confirm no hot-path regression).
- **`[deps.vani]` `0.9.4` → `0.9.5`** — pure upstream pin sweep; `vani-core`
  code byte-identical, the `audio_*` ABI `src/audio.cyr` uses is unchanged.
- **`[deps.bsp]` `1.1.3` → `1.1.5`** — bsp's own 6.3.5 pin release; `dist/bsp.cyr`
  bundle byte-identical, the `bsp_*` geometry ABI is unchanged.
- **Regenerated `cyrius.lock`** (`rm -rf lib && cyrius deps`): 37 leaves, 5
  commit-pinned, `cyrius deps --verify` **37/0**. Transitive trio unmoved (vani
  0.9.5 still pins yukti 2.2.4 / patra 1.9.5; sakshi 2.2.5 via stdlib); only the
  vani/bsp git rows + the 6.3.5 stdlib leaves re-hash.

### Security

- Picks up cyrius **CVE-32 (P1)** fix (6.2.45, in the 6.3.5 band) — a
  path-traversal in the modular dep resolver. doom doesn't use `modular=` so its
  surface was nil, but the resolver itself is now hardened.

## [0.30.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Sprite draw-loop out-of-bounds read → ring-3 #PF on AGNOS during sustained close-range combat (`src/sprite.cyr`).** A point-blank sprite — the muzzle-flash / projectile sprites added in the 0.30.x shooting work — has a tiny view-space `vy`, so `scale = PROJ_DIST/vy` and the unclamped `sprite_w` (sprite.cyr:307) blow up to tens of thousands. The sprite-column draw loop then computed `scr_x = sx1 + c` up to ~91,880 and read `clip_top[scr_x]`/`clip_bottom[scr_x]` — 320-entry per-screen-column arrays — walking ~734 KB off the end. On AGNOS (guard-unmapped pages) that is a clean ring-3 page fault (CR2 ≈ `0x12xxxxxx`, the `clip_top` heap chunk → DOOM locks up after ~1–2 min of play); on stock hardware it would silently corrupt adjacent heap. The two `if (scr_x < 0 / >= SCREEN_WIDTH) continue;` guards that should have caught it were **dead no-ops** under the former `cyrius = "6.1.37"` pin, which miscompiled `continue` inside this large function to a jump-to-loop-body (fixed in cyrius 6.2.x). **Fix:** range-clamp the draw loop — `c ∈ [max(0,-sx1), min(sprite_w, SCREEN_WIDTH-sx1))` — so `scr_x` is provably in `[0, SCREEN_WIDTH)` by construction, independent of `continue` codegen, and the loop no longer iterates the huge off-screen column excess (a per-frame perf cliff). Diagnosed from the AGNOS iron #PF (CR2=0x120b3740, RIP=0x45ff1d) + objdump of the stripped binary. Validated: `doom-smoke` (title render) + `doom-ingame-smoke` (E1M1 3D) PASS; both `doom` + `doom_agnos` rebuilt clean.

### Changed
- **Bumped the `cyrius` toolchain pin `6.1.37` → `6.2.44`** (`cyrius.cyml`). 6.2.x fixes the `continue`-in-large-function miscompile that masked the sprite OOB above (so the in-source bounds guards work again as defense-in-depth), and aligns with the current ecosystem toolchain.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-06-14

Player-feedback patch — live-play fixes plus control fidelity. Fixed a combat
coredump (shooting a monster) and the dead main-menu "Options" item; raised the
fist so its thumb clears the status bar; and reworked the controls so AGNOS gains
DOOM-faithful Ctrl-fire and Shift-to-turn while Linux keeps a simple,
Caps-Lock-immune keyboard scheme. Binary **612,576 B** (+2,000 over 0.30.1).
Tests **63/63** WAD-free, **101/101** full.

### Added

- **Options menu screen** — selecting "Options" on the main menu opened nothing
  (the case was unhandled, a silent no-op). Added a navigable `MENU_OPTIONS`
  screen (`M_OPTTTL` heading + End Game / Messages / Graphic Detail / Screen Size
  / Mouse Sensitivity / Sound Volume, original DOOM `OptionsDef` layout, skull
  cursor). The individual settings are display-only stubs for now; `ESC` / `Q`
  returns to the main menu. Also added the screen to `--ppm-menu`
  (`/tmp/doom_options.ppm`). (`src/menu.cyr`, `src/main.cyr`)

### Changed

- **Controls: AGNOS gains Shift-to-turn; Linux keeps arrows-to-turn** — the
  intended scheme (arrows strafe, **Shift**+A/D or **Shift**+arrows turn) is
  carried on the **AGNOS** path, which reads raw PS/2 scancodes: Shift is a real
  key (`0x2A`/`0x36`) tracked in `key_state`, so A/D and the arrows branch
  strafe↔turn on it, and Caps Lock is inherently ignored (letters always decode
  lowercase). On **Linux** a raw tty can't report a bare Shift (modifier, no
  byte) and reading it from uppercase letters is ambiguous with Caps Lock, so the
  Linux build keeps the simple, robust scheme — **arrows turn, A/D strafe** —
  until mouse input lands. Movement is Caps-Lock-immune there: uppercase
  `W`/`A`/`S`/`D`/`R` alias their lowercase movement actions, so Caps Lock can't
  blow out movement. (`src/input.cyr`, `README.md`)
- **Fire mapped to Ctrl (DOOM-faithful)** — original DOOM fires with Ctrl. Added
  left/right Ctrl → fire on the AGNOS input path (raw PS/2 scancode `0x1D`, plus
  the `E0 1D` right-Ctrl extended form), wired through a new `KEY_CTRL` (132)
  entry in the fire-flag builder of both poll paths. A raw Linux tty can't report
  a bare Ctrl (it's a modifier — only Ctrl+key yields a byte), so on Linux the
  `KEY_CTRL` slot is never set and **F stays the working fire key everywhere**.
  Net effect: Ctrl fires on AGNOS/real-keyboard; F fires on Linux/tty.
  (`src/input.cyr`, `README.md`)

### Fixed

- **Combat coredump (`thing_animate` switch miscompile)** — shooting a monster
  crashed the game with a corrupted return (`SIGSEGV` @ `RIP=0x1`, sometimes
  `SIGILL`). Root cause: cycc's jump-table codegen for `thing_animate`'s
  `switch (state)` emitted a frame that smashed the function's own return
  address. The switch had sparse/out-of-order case labels (`case 8` sat between
  `1` and `2`) and `var` declarations inside case bodies; the smash detonated at
  a later `ret` (e.g. a `STATE_PAIN` thing's `thing_set_frame`), which is why it
  presented as a "death" crash. Reproduced deterministically (force-damage
  monsters → pain/die animation) and isolated by bisection — removing the switch
  eliminated the crash. **Fix:** rewrote the state→frame mapping as an
  equivalent `if/else` ladder (cycc's if-codegen is solid); clean under sustained
  combat. Not toolchain-specific — identical miscompiled binary under both the
  pinned cycc 6.1.37 and 6.2.2. (`src/things.cyr`)
- **Fist thumb hidden behind the status bar** — the first weapon (fists, `PUNG`)
  sat too low: its thumb lives in the bottom-left of the sprite (rows 32-41),
  which the shared psprite anchor maps to screen rows 174-183 — entirely behind
  the status bar (top at 168), so the thumb never showed. (DOOM clips it the same
  way in status-bar mode; the reference fist animation shows the standalone
  sprite.) Added a per-weapon vertical lift (`weapon_y_lift`, zero for every gun)
  and set the fist to **14 px** so the thumb clears the bar while the wrist stays
  tucked behind it. Verified against a real-binary `--ppm` render. (`src/render.cyr`)

## [0.30.1] - 2026-06-13

Player-feedback patch — four rendering/animation bugs reported from live play:
the weapon stuck dead-center with its firing animation "totally off" and no
muzzle flash, walls warping/mirroring when turning, and enemies appearing to
always face the player. Closes the **U-swap-mirror** and **muzzle-flash-overlay**
items deferred from 0.29.4 / 0.30.0. Binary **610,576 B** (+2,232 over 0.30.0).
`render_frame` **2.957 ms** / `+sprites` **2.952 ms** (E1M1, cycc 6.2.2) — render
path effectively unchanged from 0.30.0 (within run-to-run variance); the extra
combined-rotation lump lookups don't register at the E1M1 spawn sprite count.
~7× headroom on the 22 ms budget.

### Added

- **Muzzle flash overlay** — firing now draws DOOM's separate `ps_flash` psprite
  (`PISF` / `SHTF` / `CHGF` / `MISF`) fullbright over the gun
  (`render_draw_flash`; per-weapon flash family + frame count set in
  `render_set_weapon`). 0.30.0 only lit the *gun* fullbright on fire — the actual
  flash sprite was never drawn. Melee weapons (fist/chainsaw) have no flash;
  plasma's `PLSF` is absent in the shareware WAD (guarded by `wad_find_lump < 0`).
  Closes the 0.30.0-deferred "separate muzzle-flash overlay sprite" roadmap item.

### Fixed

- **Weapon psprite position + firing animation.** The gun was placed at
  `sx = 253 + leftoffset`, `sy = 228 + topoffset`, which equals the correct
  DOOM `sx = 1 − leftoffset`, `sy = 16 − topoffset` **only when
  leftoffset == −126 and topoffset == −106** — i.e. exactly the pistol ready
  frame (`PISGA0`), by coincidence. Every other weapon and every other animation
  frame (each lump has its own offsets) was mispositioned, so the fist sat
  dead-center (should be lower-right) and the gun lurched across the screen as it
  fired. Replaced with the DOOM-accurate hotspot formula via a shared
  `render_blit_psprite` blitter. (roadmap reference-parity #1, `R_DrawPSprite`)
- **Wall texture mirrored when turning.** `render_seg`'s `sx1 > sx2` swap
  reordered the screen-X / depth endpoints but **not** the texture-U endpoints,
  so any seg projecting right-to-left rendered its texture mirrored — and flipped
  the instant a turn crossed that screen-order threshold ("walls warp when
  turning"). The U endpoints now swap with screen order, in both the wall pass
  and the deferred masked-midtexture pass (`render_masked_segs`). (roadmap
  wall-path #7, MED)
- **Enemies always faced the player.** `sprite_find_frame` only looked up the
  6-char single-rotation lump (`TROOA1`); DOOM packs rotations 2/3/4/6/7/8 into
  combined 8-char lumps (`TROOA2A8` = rotation 2, and rotation 8 mirrored), so
  every rotation but 1 and 5 missed and fell back to the front view. It now
  resolves the combined lumps and returns a flip flag; `sprite_render_all`
  mirrors the patch columns when set. Verified against the WAD: 1→`TROOA1`,
  2→`TROOA2A8`, 3→`TROOA3A7`, 4→`TROOA4A6`, 5→`TROOA5`, 6→`TROOA4A6`(flip),
  7→`TROOA3A7`(flip), 8→`TROOA2A8`(flip). `_spr_prefix` scratch grown 8 → 16 B
  to hold the 8-char names.
- **Monster walk strobe.** SEE/CHASE flipped the two walk frames every 35 Hz
  tick (`thing_animate` runs each tick), ~10× too fast. Now gated to a ~4-tick
  cadence, staggered by thing index (matches DOOM `*_RUN` ≈3-tic frames).

### Notes

- No control changes: fire stays on **F**; **Space** = use and **Enter** keep
  their roles (a brief experiment binding fire to Space/Enter was reverted at the
  user's request — those keys are meant to be other buttons).

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-13

Shooting-mechanics overhaul — a multi-agent review of the full path (input →
hitscan → damage → psprite render) surfaced 27 confirmed findings; this cut
fixes the correctness bugs and closes the biggest DOOM-fidelity gaps. Binary
**602,032 → 608,344 B** (+6,312). `render_frame` **3.10 ms** (E1M1, cycc 6.2.2)
— render path unchanged; the only per-frame addition is the weapon's
sector-light lookup, which is not on the measured path. ~7× headroom on the
22 ms budget.

### Added

- **Deterministic combat RNG** — `p_random` / `p_random_range` (LCG, fixed seed
  in `tables_init`) in `tables.cyr`. Replaces `tick_get_count() % N` damage
  rolls, which tied damage to the frame counter. Drives damage spread,
  painchance, pellet scatter, and splash falloff; reproducible for tests/demos.
- **Rocket projectile + radius damage** — the launcher now spawns a travelling
  `CAT_PROJECTILE` thing (`thing_spawn_missile`) that flies, renders its MISL
  sprite, and detonates on a wall / thing / lifetime via `thing_explode`
  (linear-falloff splash to things **and** the player). Spent slots are reused.
- **Barrel explosions + chain reactions** — shooting a barrel to death now
  detonates it (`thing_explode`, 128-unit / 128-dmg), which can pop adjacent
  barrels; the corpse-guard bounds the recursion.
- **Shotgun spread** — 7 independent pellets (±~2.8° scatter), 5–15 dmg each,
  instead of a single hitscan ×3.
- **Per-weapon refire cadence** — `weapon_fire_ticks` set per weapon in
  `render_set_weapon` (chaingun fast, shotgun/rocket slow) instead of one
  global `FIRE_TICKS`. Weapon 7 (plasma, `PLSG`) added to the sprite/cadence map.
- **Dry-fire feedback** — `sound_weapon_dry` click when firing empty (edge-latched,
  once per trigger pull); `sound_plasma` for weapon 7.
- **Per-monster painchance** (`thing_painchance`) — DOOM-matched flinch odds.
- **Combat unit tests** (`tests/doom.tcyr`, +26 asserts: WAD-free **37 → 63**,
  full **75 → 101**) covering p_random, ammo deduction, damage/state transitions,
  hitscan selection + LOS, splash falloff, and the rocket projectile — plus a
  hermetic-stub block so the WAD-free subset can exercise the combat path.
- **`fuzz/fuzz_weapon.cyr`** — drives the real `render_draw_weapon` decoder with
  malformed one-lump WADs (20k iters clean).
- Security research: `docs/audit/2026-06-13-shooting-hitscan.md` (P(-1)).

### Fixed

- **Unbounded fire cadence** (review #1). The fire block deducted ammo and ran
  `player_hitscan` *every 35 Hz tick* the fire key was held — 35 shots/sec, a
  magazine gone in ~1.4 s, 35× intended DPS — because only the sprite animation
  was gated, not the shot. The shot is now gated on the weapon being ready
  (`weapon_fire_frame == 0`), i.e. once per refire period.
- **Shoot-through-walls** (review #2). `player_hitscan` had no line-of-sight
  check; bullets passed through solid walls into adjacent rooms. Now reuses
  `thing_check_sight` (the monster-AI sight primitive) to reject blocked targets.
- **Pain-lock / stun-lock** (review #3). Every hit forced `STATE_PAIN`/tics=5
  unconditionally, so sustained fire froze any monster forever and spammed the
  pain sound each tick. Pain is now painchance-gated and not re-entered while
  already flinching.
- **Corpse re-kill** (review #4). Shooting a dying thing reset `STATE_DIE`/tics
  and replayed the death sound, so the animation never finished. `thing_damage`
  now early-returns on `STATE_DIE`/`STATE_DEAD`.
- **Vanishing corpses** (review #5). The death→corpse transition cleared
  `TF_ACTIVE`, and `sprite_render_all` skips inactive things, so bodies popped
  out of existence. Corpses keep `TF_ACTIVE | TF_CORPSE` (visible, inert,
  un-shootable).
- **psprite memory leak** (review #6). `render_update_weapon_lump` `alloc(8)`'d a
  lump-name buffer on every firing frame and weapon switch, never freeing it.
  Now a single lazy-init-guarded buffer.
- **Weapon 7 (plasma) fired silently with fall-through damage** (review #7) —
  now has an explicit damage and sound case.
- **No-map robustness** — `render_draw_weapon`'s new sector-light path is guarded
  on `map_num_sectors > 0`, so it can't deref a null sector table off the map.

### Changed (DOOM fidelity)

- **Rocket** is a projectile with splash, not an instant single-target hitscan
  (review #9). **Shotgun** is a 7-pellet spread, not hitscan ×3 (review #8).
  **Chaingun** has its own (fast) cadence rather than being a re-skinned pistol
  (review #10).
- **Weapon brightness** tracks the player's sector and goes full-bright during
  the fire animation (muzzle-flash glow), replacing the hardcoded `light_level 4`
  (review #11).
- **Damage variety** comes from `p_random`, decorrelated from game time (#15).
- **Idle monsters wake when shot** even without prior line of sight.
- **Overkill** (hp below the negative of spawn health) resolves the death faster
  (a lightweight gib; full xdeath giblet sprites are a follow-up).

### Notes

- The weapon **bob** was reviewed and left unchanged: DOOM's `psp->sy` bob uses a
  half-angle sine (a one-directional dip), which the existing `fixed_abs(cos)`
  already matches — the review's "make it symmetric" was a misread.
- Deferred (cosmetic): BEXP rocket-explosion frames, separate muzzle-flash
  overlay sprite, full xdeath giblet animation. Missile-vs-wall reuses
  `player_check_position`, so a rocket can clip on tall steps in this 2.5D engine.

## [0.29.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Player walked through every wall** (user-reported from interactive play).
  Root cause: `player_check_position` computed each BLOCKMAP cell index as
  `fixed_to_int(asr(nx - radius - map_bm_originx, 16)) / 128`. The world-space
  offset is already 16.16 fixed-point (both `player_x` and `map_bm_originx`
  carry `<<16`), so `fixed_to_int` (= `asr 16`) is the *only* shift needed —
  the extra inner `asr(…, 16)` made it `asr 32`, collapsing every real map
  offset (< 65536 units) to **0**. Every collision query therefore scanned only
  blockmap cell **(0,0)** (the SW corner), so the player collided with nothing
  outside it. Latent since **0.13.0** (when the BLOCKMAP path + the `<<16` on
  `map_bm_originx` were added together); only exposed once interactive movement
  landed (0.28.3 AGNOS keyboard + 0.29.x world-tick aliveness). Fixed to a
  single `fixed_to_int` shift. Reproduced + verified with a probe on E1M1:
  spawn cell `(0,0)→(14,9)`, and a ±2048-unit collision sweep through spawn
  went from **0/65 blocked → 5/65 (X) + 1/65 (Y) blocked**. Added a permanent
  collision regression assertion to `tests/doom.tcyr` (full suite 73 → 75) —
  the bug survived 16 minors precisely because nothing exercised it.

- **Wall "black holes" / dropped-wall void** (user-reported; E1M9 ~70% of the
  view black with monster sprites floating through where solid walls belong,
  E1M3 central black rectangle, E1M7 left rectangle, E1M1 far doorways). A
  multi-agent A/B-render diagnosis (4 diagnosers + adversarial verification)
  **empirically refuted** every geometry/clip/overflow hypothesis (NEAR_CLIP
  degenerate depth, `fixed_mul(tx,PROJ_DIST)` 64-bit overflow, one-sided-wall
  clip-drop, U/scale swap mispairing) — none move the black. The entire family
  is **two independent texture-resolution bugs**:
  - **PNAMES 8-char patch names never resolved.** `wad_name_eq` runs
    `strlen(name)` on the raw 8-byte PNAMES field; WAD names are null-padded
    *only* when shorter than 8 chars, so the 161/350 entries that are exactly 8
    chars have no terminator and the word-at-a-time `strlen` over-reads past
    byte 8, returns `>8`, and rejects the name → `patch_lumps[i] = -1` →
    `texture_get_column` composites nothing → framebuffer-black. `texture_init`
    now copies each field into a null-terminated 9-byte buffer before the
    lookup. **Alone:** E1M9 70.7% → 1.0% viewport black, E1M1 7.6% → 0.6%.
  - **Patch cache truncated patches > 8192 B.** `PCACHE_DATA_SIZE = 8192` kept
    only the first 8192 bytes of large patches; the `col_off >= pdata_size`
    bound in `texture_get_column` then dropped every column whose directory
    offset landed past the truncation → all-zero (black) column. BIGDOOR2
    (`DOOR2_4`, 17544 B) lost columns 58–127. Raised to **40960** (covers
    DOOM1.WAD's largest PNAMES-referenced patch, `WALL24_1` at 36960 B; heap
    cache grows 64 KB → 320 KB via `alloc`, binary unaffected). **On top of the
    PNAMES fix:** E1M3 10.5% → 0.0% (111 distinct viewport colors), E1M7
    17.8% → 0.1%.

  Combined, all four maps end at **≤ 0.1%** viewport black (rows 0–167),
  visually whole. Verification: 37/37 WAD-free, 75/75 full,
  `fuzz_wad` 1000/1000, `fuzz_fixed` 50000/50000; nine-map PPMs at 192,015 B.
  Bench: `render_frame` 2.451 → **2.93 ms** — A/B-isolated to the PNAMES fix
  (the renderer now actually composites and draws the wall textures that were
  previously unresolved black no-ops), **not** the cache bump (PCACHE 8192 vs
  40960 = 0.011 ms = variance). ~7.5× headroom on the 22 ms budget. Linux
  601,936 → **602,032 B** (+96 B); `--agnos` 580,960 → **581,072 B** (+112 B).
  Built under cycc **6.2.2** (launcher ignores the 6.1.37 pin — see state.md
  toolchain row). **AGNOS QEMU verified on the final binary** (581,072 B):
  `doom-smoke.sh` PASS (serial `cyrius-doom v0.29.4` + `wad loaded`, framebuffer
  240 colors), and the in-game sendkey harness (`doom-ingame-smoke.py`) drove
  into E1M1 and rendered **textured walls + floors + ceilings with no void** —
  viewport-black **0.06%** and **104** distinct colors, identical to the Linux
  render's 0.06% / 104 (the menu-drive viewpoint differs only slightly, so this
  is rendering-equivalence, not a literal same-pixel diff). No `--agnos` codegen
  hazard (constant/alloc/cold-path changes only; the 6.1.37 fold fix holds).

### Notes

- The diagnosis re-attributed two roadmap "Wall-path correctness" items: the
  closed-door black holes (E1M3/4/7) and the near-parallel one-sided wall drop
  (E1M9) were **not** the geometry/clip defects originally hypothesized — both
  were the texture-resolution bugs above. Two findings that *survived*
  refutation but were **not** exercised by the spawn-view A/B remain open (now
  on the roadmap): `closed-sector-clip-inversion` (HIGH — a two-sided line
  backing a closed/zero-height sector inverts the column clip; reproduces only
  facing a closed door *during play*) and `wall-u-swap-mirror` (MED — the
  `sx1>sx2` swap reorders sx/ty but not the texture-U endpoints, mirroring
  right-to-left segs). NEAR_CLIP=256 was A/B-proven **not** a black-hole cause
  and is intentionally out of scope.

## [0.29.3] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **Floor/ceiling flats rendered as untextured gray smears** (user-reported from
  AGNOS hardware; reproduced identically on Linux `--ppm` — the smear color just
  lands on different texels per viewpoint). Root cause: `render_flat_spans`
  computed the per-row plane distance as `fixed_div(VIEW_HEIGHT, dy<<16)` =
  `41/dy`, omitting the `PROJ_DIST` projection factor (true distance =
  `41·160/dy`, DOOM's `planeheight·yslope[y]`). The distance being 160× too
  small collapsed the per-pixel world step to ~0 — **one texel smeared across
  each row**, so flats showed no texture — and pinned the zlight index to ~0,
  so flats never light-faded with distance. Fixed:
  `dist = fixed_div(fixed_mul(plane_h, PROJ_DIST), dy << 16)`. Adversarially
  verified (units/overflow audit, DOOM-fidelity audit, refutation attempt
  failed on all vectors): the span mapping is now the exact algebraic inverse
  of the wall projection, and zlight indexing matches the documented
  `r_main.c` scheme. Three follow-up defects from the same multi-agent review,
  fixed in the same cut:
  - **Sky overdrawn by the span pass (regression-by-unmasking)**: `F_SKY1` is a
    real 4096-byte flat lump (shareware flat index 53), and sky-ceiling rows
    were still registered into `vp_ceil_*` — so once flats actually textured,
    the span pass overdrew the wall-pass sky with F_SKY1's noise content. Sky
    rows no longer register. (Full sky correctness still pends the visplane
    pool rewrite: a non-sky ceiling sharing a row can still bridge its x-union
    across sky columns.)
  - **Wall fake-contrast leaked into plane lighting**: the ±1 axis-orientation
    lightnum adjustment was applied *before* the `vp_*_light` stores, so a
    flat's brightness inherited the orientation of whichever seg last marked
    the row (DOOM applies fake contrast to walls only). Planes now store the
    pre-contrast sector lightnum.
  - **Ceiling spans mapped/lit at constant plane height 41**: the wall pass
    projects ceiling rows with the true `ceil−floor−41` delta, but the span
    pass inverted with `41` — ceilings in any room not exactly 82 tall were
    radially mis-scaled (≈2.1× in a 128-tall room) and mis-lit. New per-row
    `vp_ceil_h` stores the wall-pass delta for the span pass to invert with
    (floors need no equivalent: their delta is always exactly `VIEW_HEIGHT`
    under the per-seg eye model). Below-eye degenerate deltas fall back to
    `VIEW_HEIGHT`, preserving prior behavior.
  - Dead `plane_eye_h` removed.

  Verification: 37/37 WAD-free + 73/73 full suite; all nine shareware maps
  PPM-rendered (192,015 B each) and visually verified — floor rows now carry
  16–33 distinct colors vs 1–3 pre-fix, with correct perspective convergence
  and distance fade. `--agnos` QEMU-verified **on the final 0.29.3 release
  binary** (580,960 B): `doom-smoke.sh` PASS (serial `cyrius-doom v0.29.3` +
  `wad loaded`, fb 240 colors), in-game E1M1 sendkey harness screendump shows
  textured tiled floors with depth lighting, and the AGNOS framebuffer is
  **99.99% pixel-identical to the Linux render** at 4× block scale (7/64,000
  px — idle-monster anim tick skew). A serial probe earlier in the cut
  confirmed `fixed_mul(VIEW_HEIGHT, PROJ_DIST) = 429916160` identical to
  Linux (no backend fold regression). Final binaries: Linux 601,936 B,
  `--agnos` 580,960 B (+320 B each for the `vp_ceil_h` plumbing). Bench:
  `render_frame` **2.451 ms** (0.29.2 row 2.492 ms — variance-level). NOTE:
  built under cycc **6.2.2** (the installed launcher resolves cycc via
  CYRIUS_HOME/PATH and ignores the 6.1.37 pin — even the
  `versions/6.1.37/bin` path; lockfile unchanged, verifies 37/0).

### Notes

- The review confirmed the **per-row single-visplane model** as the largest
  remaining flat defect (farthest-seg-wins flat/light per row; `x1..x2` union
  bridges interposed walls and sky columns) — already slotted as the visplane
  pool rewrite. The review adds to that slot's motivation: no global `viewz`
  (eye is per-seg `front_floor+41`, flattening elevation), the E1M5 step-down
  back-floor bleed, and portal clip updates ignoring front-sector plane bounds.
- New wall-path bugs surfaced (separate from flats, now on the roadmap):
  closed-door faces render as black holes (BIGDOOR2/4 — E1M3/E1M4/E1M7);
  near-view-parallel one-sided walls dropped entirely (E1M9 spawn corridor,
  ~70% of the view black); SLADRIP wall animation is a no-op (rotates the name
  hash together with the entry, so by-name lookup follows the rotation);
  `FLAT_MAX=64` silently truncates full-IWAD flats (shareware's 54 fit); flat V
  axis mirrored vs vanilla (`+worldY` instead of `−worldY`); vendored bsp
  `asr()` is round-toward-zero rather than floor (one-texel flat mis-wrap in
  negative-coordinate map regions).

## [0.29.2] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Toolchain pin `6.1.29` → `6.1.37`** (`cyrius.cyml`). cycc 6.1.37 fixes the
  `--agnos` 3-operand-chained-constant-multiply miscompile (known issue #3), so
  the 0.29.1 2-operand workarounds are reverted to the clean chained form:
  `framebuf.cyr` `fb_buf = alloc(SCREEN_WIDTH * SCREEN_HEIGHT * 4)` and
  `render.cyr` `scalelight`/`zlight = alloc(LIGHTLEVELS * MAXLIGHT* * 8)`.
  **Verified the fold on the actual `--agnos` binary in QEMU** (serial probe):
  `fb_buf=256000`, `scalelight=6144`, `zlight=16384` — all correct (would be 800
  / undersized under cycc ≤ 6.1.35). `doom-smoke.sh` PASS — DOOM renders on AGNOS,
  240-colour framebuffer, no heap overflow. `cyrius.lock` regenerated for the new
  pin (clean `rm -rf lib && cyrius deps` → **37 entries**, verify 37/0). Linux
  build 601,568 B; 37/37 + 73/73; `render_frame` 2.557 ms (perf-neutral; codegen
  changed with the pin so cross-version comparison is not valid).

### Fixed

- **Standing still showed a dead world — monsters never woke and idle monsters
  never animated.** Two root causes, both reproduced via a pseudo-terminal
  harness driving the real-tty input path (the 35 Hz loop itself was already live
  at a verified 35.3 Hz after 0.29.1 — the *world* just wasn't visibly changing):
  - **Monster sight was capped at 1000 units.** `thing_ai_tick`'s SPAWN→SEE gate
    required `dist < MONSTER_SIGHT_RANGE` (1000 units), so all but the nearest
    monsters stayed permanently asleep — a probe at the E1M1 spawn found the
    nearest monster 936 units away and only 1 of 29 inside the cap. Real DOOM
    gates wake-up on line-of-sight (P_CheckSight) with **no distance cap**; the
    cap and the `MONSTER_SIGHT_RANGE` constant are removed. Monsters now wake on
    LOS as the player advances (verified: holding forward, `chase` count climbs
    0→1→2 and `see`→2 as line-of-sight opens). `thing_check_sight` already culls
    monsters with a one-sided wall between them and the player.
  - **Idle monsters rendered a single static frame.** `thing_animate`'s SPAWN
    case pinned monsters to frame 0; real DOOM's `*_STND` states alternate the
    two standing frames. Idle monsters now loop frames A↔B at an ~8-tick cadence,
    staggered by thing index (verified: idle frame-sum oscillates with zero
    input). Non-monster idle things (single-frame decor, items) stay on frame 0 —
    alternating them would request a B sprite many decorations don't have.

### Notes

- The E1M1 *spawn point itself* stays quiet with zero input even after these
  fixes — no monster anywhere has line-of-sight into the spawn alcove (faithful
  to DOOM). Visible ambient life now comes from idle-monster animation of any
  monster in view, and from monsters waking as the player moves. Sector light
  specials (flicker/strobe/glow) remain unimplemented — a future ambient-life
  item, not in this cut.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Game world tick froze without player input — two distinct, platform-specific
  root causes, both found by *reproducing* the freeze (Linux locally, AGNOS in
  QEMU via `agnos/scripts/doom-smoke.sh`), not by static reading.** The world-tick
  calls (`player_tick`/`doors_tick`/`things_tick`/`texture_animate`) are
  unconditional in the loop, so both bugs sat upstream of them and stalled the
  whole 35 Hz loop.
  - **Linux: `read(stdin)` blocked the loop.** `input_poll`'s `read(0)` only polls
    non-blocking when stdin is a real tty whose raw-mode `TCSETS` honored `VMIN=0`
    (the 0.28.4 fix). For any *other* stdin — pipe, FIFO, redirect, the `x11view`
    GTK bridge, or when the `ioctl` silently failed because stdin is not a tty —
    `VMIN`/`VTIME` are ignored and `read(0)` BLOCKS until a byte arrives, freezing
    the loop in `input_poll` before any world tick. Fix: `input_enable_raw_mode`
    now also forces `O_NONBLOCK` on fd 0 via `fcntl` (a non-blocking guarantee
    independent of tty/`VMIN` state); `input_poll`'s existing `if (n > 0)` guard
    already treats `EAGAIN`/`n<=0` as "no input this frame". `input_disable_raw_mode`
    restores the saved flags on exit so the parent shell's stdin is not left
    non-blocking. Reproduced: a no-data stdin froze the game on its first frame
    (0 iterations); after the fix the world advances at ~33 Hz with zero input
    (103 frames / 3 s).
  - **AGNOS: a 255 KB per-frame heap overflow corrupted the render tables.**
    `framebuf_init` sized the blit conversion buffer as
    `alloc(SCREEN_WIDTH * SCREEN_HEIGHT * 4)` — a compile-time-constant **3-operand
    chained multiply that cycc's `--agnos` backend miscompiles** (`320*200*4` folds
    to **800**, not 256000; the 2-operand `320*200=64000` and runtime 3-operand
    multiplies are correct, and the Linux target folds it correctly). The resulting
    800-byte `fb_buf` vs the 256000 bytes `framebuf_blit_agnos` writes every frame
    stomped `colormap` / `zlight` / `flat_cache` (allocated just above `fb_buf`).
    Frame 1 rendered with intact tables; frame 1's `framebuf_flip` corrupted them;
    frame 2's `render_flat_spans` read a corrupted `zlight` → wild `colormap`
    pointer → ring-3 page fault → "frozen after one frame". Fix: size `fb_buf` as
    `SCREEN_SIZE * 4` (2-operand), and split the two light-table allocations
    (`scalelight` / `zlight` in `render_init_light_tables`) into a 2-operand entry
    count × 8 — all avoiding the miscompiled pattern. Reproduced + fixed in QEMU:
    idle world-advance went from 1 frame to continuous (105+ frames, no input).
    **Iron burn on archaemenid still pending.**

### Notes

- **cycc `--agnos` toolchain bug (report upstream):** compile-time-constant
  3-operand chained integer multiplies (`A * B * C`, all constant-folded)
  miscompile on the `--agnos` target only (confirmed cycc 6.1.29 + 6.1.35).
  Worked around in `framebuf.cyr` + `render.cyr`; audit any new all-constant
  `alloc(X * Y * Z)` site for the same trap.
- `--ppm` screenshot mode renders a single static frame and never enters the
  world-tick loop, so neither freeze was reachable through any PPM/CI gate — the
  reproductions had to drive the interactive loop.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **agnos: the kernel scales now** — `framebuf_blit_agnos` no longer expands scale² pixels in
  ring 3; it palette-converts the raw 320×200 frame into a FIXED 256 KB 32bpp buffer and passes
  the integer scale to the kernel via `blit`(#39) a4 bits [39:32] (agnos 1.44.20). Per frame,
  ring 3 writes **64 K pixels instead of scale²·64 K**, and the old heap-budget scale cap (3)
  is gone — the panel's natural integer scale applies (e.g. **7 on 2560×1440**, capped at the
  kernel's 16). On an older kernel the scale bits are ignored (unscaled centered placement —
  degraded but harmless); ship with agnos ≥ 1.44.20.

## [0.28.4] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Player movement was 90° out of phase with the rendered view.**
  `render_transform_vertex` and the two `sprite.cyr` transforms computed
  view-space depth as `dy·cos − dx·sin`, orienting "forward / into-screen"
  toward north (BAM 256), while player movement, hitscan, the floor-span pass
  (`render_flat_spans`), and the map's thing-angle convention all use
  `(cos, sin)` = east (BAM 0, `degrees·1024/360`). Pressing forward therefore
  slid the player sideways relative to what was on screen, and walls disagreed
  with floors by 90°. Walls + sprites now use the same `(cos, sin)` convention:
  `ty = dx·cos + dy·sin` (depth), `tx = dx·sin − dy·cos` (lateral — the
  screen-right axis `(sin, −cos)` that `render_flat_spans` already used, verified
  against it so left/right is not mirrored). The `--ppm` view now faces the
  map-intended direction (the canonical E1M1 opening). Latent since the renderer
  was validated only via still `--ppm` screenshots; surfaced once the engine was
  driven interactively.
- **Player walked straight through solid walls.** `player_check_linedef`
  early-returned "passable" for any line that was neither `ML_BLOCKING` nor
  `ML_TWOSIDED` — i.e. every ordinary one-sided wall, which carries no
  `ML_BLOCKING` flag in the WAD (it is implicitly solid by having no back
  sidedef). One-sided lines (`!ML_TWOSIDED` / `side_left < 0`) are now solid at
  the distance test; two-sided step-up (≤24) / ceiling-fit logic unchanged.
- **35 Hz loop stalled between keystrokes on the Linux `/dev/fb0` path.** The
  raw-mode termios setup wrote `VMIN`/`VTIME` at byte offsets 22/21, assuming
  `c_cc` began at offset 16 — but the kernel `struct termios` carries a `c_line`
  byte at 16, so `c_cc` starts at 17 (`VTIME`=22, `VMIN`=23). `VMIN` was never
  zeroed and kept the terminal's inherited value of 1, making `read(stdin)`
  blocking; the game loop — and therefore `things_tick` / `doors_tick` — only
  advanced when a key arrived (monsters/doors froze when standing still).
  Corrected to offsets 23/22. (Linux path only; the AGNOS path uses `kbscan#42`
  and is unaffected.)
- **Oblique walls bowed (perspective distortion).** `render_seg` and
  `render_masked_segs` interpolated depth (`z`) linearly across screen columns,
  but for a flat wall it is the scale (`PROJ_DIST / z`), not `z`, that is linear
  in screen-x. Both loops now interpolate scale and derive per-column depth,
  straightening wall top/bottom edges and texture-height scaling on angled walls.
  `render_frame` 2.520 ms (perf-neutral; 22 ms budget).
- **Boot diagnostics bypassed sakshi.** The `loading map` / `map: <name>`,
  `map: V=… L=…` stats, and `things: N total (…)` lines were bare
  `syscall(1, …)` writes, rendering as un-prefixed bare lines interleaved with
  the structured `[ts] [INFO]` log. All three now route through `sakshi_info`
  (the two stat lines via `fmt_sprintf`), so they carry the standard prefix.

### Changed

- **Toolchain pin → `cycc 6.1.29`** (`cyrius.cyml`, was 6.0.83). The local
  toolchain launchers resolve the newest installed `cycc` regardless of the
  versioned path, so the pin now matches the only compiler that actually runs
  and the build is no longer "drift"-warned. Build 600,848 B; 37/37 + 73/73;
  `render_frame` 2.520 ms (cross-version perf vs 0.28.0 is not comparable — the
  codegen + bundled stdlib changed with the pin).
- **`cyrius.lock` regenerated for the new pin.** `./lib/` is a gitignored build
  artifact that `cyrius deps` populates from the pinned toolchain's stdlib, so
  bumping the pin changes the lock's contents. Regenerated via a clean resolve
  (`rm -rf lib && cyrius deps`) → **37 entries**; `cyrius deps --verify` 37/0.
  CI keeps the unchanged `cyrius deps` → `cyrius deps --verify` flow — a clean
  checkout resolves `./lib/` from the pinned stdlib and verifies 37/0.

## [0.28.3] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Keyboard input on AGNOS — DOOM is now playable past the title screen.** The
  `--agnos` build rendered its title but took no input (the loop sat on TITLEPIC
  forever): the old `input_poll` agnos branch returned no keys, because AGNOS's only
  stdin path (`read`#5) is blocking + line-disciplined + cooked-to-ASCII — fatal in
  the frame loop and dropping key-up. It now drains the kernel's new **`kbscan`#42**
  (a non-blocking raw Set-1 scancode poll), decodes make/break, and keeps `key_state`
  as **persistent held state** (a key stays down until its break code arrives —
  closer to real DOOM than the Linux press-then-clear path). Mapping: WASD move/strafe,
  arrows turn (`0xE0` extended), Space/E use, F fire, R run, Tab automap, 1–7 weapons,
  Q/Esc quit. `src/input.cyr`. Validated in QEMU via `agnos/scripts/doom-input-test.py`
  (USB-xHCI keyboard + HMP `sendkey`): `w` advances title→menu, `q` quits.
  Iron burn pending. Requires AGNOS kernel with `kbscan`#42.

## [0.28.2] - 2026-06-08

**DOOM renders on AGNOS.** The `--agnos` build now boots to the title screen
under the sovereign OS: the 584 KB ELF exec's from disk in ring 3, slurps the
4.2 MB `DOOM1.WAD` into memory, parses it, builds the palette, and blits a
240-colour frame to the hardware framebuffer via `fbinfo`#38 / `blit`#39. This is
the "agnsh launches DOOM" milestone — the first real userland application on
AGNOS. (Validated by `agnos/scripts/doom-smoke.sh`: gnoboot+OVMF+NVMe, ring-3
exec, WAD load, non-blank framebuffer screendump.)

Two AGNOS *kernel* fixes (in the `agnos` repo) unblocked the render — the WAD
needs ~24 MB and the old PMM only managed 16 MB; and the kernel could not reach
physical pages ≥16 MB to zero a freshly-`mmap`'d region. Neither is a port issue.

### Added / Changed

- **Warm-up `mmap`** (`main.cyr`, agnos only) — the FIRST `mmap` syscall from a
  freshly-exec'd ring-3 process corrupts the ring-3 return state on AGNOS (a
  kernel first-syscall-return bug, doom-specific; agnsh is unaffected). A
  throwaway `mmap` before `alloc_init` makes the real heap `mmap` the second
  syscall, which returns cleanly. Documented in-place; removed once the kernel
  bug is fixed. The Linux build is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Stripped the boot-bisect debug markers added during agnos bring-up.

## [0.28.1] - 2026-06-08

**AGNOS target support — cyrius-doom builds and runs `--agnos`.** The first
port of the engine to the sovereign OS (the "agnsh launches DOOM" arc). The
engine's OS interactions are branched under `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS`, inlining the
agnos syscall numbers (which collide with Linux ones — e.g. agnos `0`=exit not
read, `2`=getpid not open, `16`=kill not ioctl), so the Linux build is byte-for-
byte unchanged.

### Added

- **Timing** (`tick.cyr`) — `tick_get_time_ns`/`tick_begin`/`tick_wait` use agnos
  `uptime_ms`(#40) + `sleep_ms`(#41) instead of `CLOCK_GETTIME`/`NANOSLEEP`.
- **Framebuffer** (`framebuf.cyr`) — `framebuf_init` queries geometry via
  `fbinfo`(#38); `framebuf_flip` builds a tightly-packed integer-scaled 32bpp
  frame and presents it via `blit`(#39) (the kernel handles the FB pitch), instead
  of `/dev/fb0` ioctls + `lseek`+`write`.
- **WAD** (`wad.cyr`) — agnos has no `lseek` (its syscall 8 is `dup`), so the WAD
  is slurped into memory at `wad_open` and the 5 seek sites route through a
  `wad_pread` offset reader. (Linux keeps the live-fd `lseek`+`read` path.)
- **Input** (`input.cyr`) — stubbed on agnos (no termios; key up/down events need
  a kernel raw-scancode mode — a follow-on). The title/menu renders without input.
- **Sound** (`sound.cyr`) — disabled on agnos (no PC-speaker `/dev/console`).
- **Process exit / WAD path** (`main.cyr`) — portable `doom_exit` (agnos exit is
  syscall 0); defaults the WAD path to `/DOOM1.WAD` when run with no argv.

### Notes

- Validated on the agnos kernel under QEMU: the 584 KB ELF execs from disk in
  ring 3, the heap/`mmap`, timing, and sakshi all initialize. WAD loading is
  currently gated on a kernel-side memory limit (the agnos 2 MB-page pool) — a
  kernel bite, not a port issue. The Linux build is unaffected (still renders).

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-07

Graphics review / hardening / audit / performance pass — the new
anchor for the 0.28.x arc. A multi-agent audit of the entire render
path (render / framebuf / texture / sprite / status / menu + the
fixed-point math feeding them) surfaced 67 raw findings, triaged to
27 canonical and adversarially verified down to 20 real ones; 8
shipped here, the rest re-slotted across 0.28.x (see
`docs/development/roadmap.md`). Audit artifact:
`docs/audit/2026-06-07-v0.28-graphics-hardening.md`.

The headline is **memory-safety hardening of the patch decoders**:
the C2-class bounds checks that have lived in `texture_get_column`
since v0.24.0 were never propagated to the other three patch
decoders (weapon, sprite, HUD/menu/title) or to the `TEXTURE1`
parser, and the visplane row loops could write out of bounds on
crafted geometry. All four decode paths now mirror
`texture_get_column`, and the visplane projection is absolutely
clamped to its row-loop bounds. Latent on the trusted shareware
IWAD, reachable under the planned PWAD support — except F17, which
also fixed a real visible artifact on E1M1.

### Security

- **`render.cyr` — heap OOB *write* in the visplane loops (F17).**
  `ceil_screen` / `floor_screen` were only *relatively* clamped
  (`>= ct`, `<= cb`); the `vp_ceil_*` / `vp_floor_*` row loops
  (each `alloc(200*8)`) used the un-capped side, so a sector with
  extreme heights at minimum depth drove the projection past the
  array and `store64` ran off the end (the arrays are alloc'd
  consecutively, so the overflow corrupted the neighbouring
  visplane bounds). Now absolutely clamped to exactly the loop
  bounds — `ceil_screen <= SCREEN_HEIGHT` (the ceiling loop is
  half-open `[ct, ceil_screen)`) and `floor_screen >= -1` (the
  floor loop is `[floor_screen+1, cb]`) — which leaves every in-band
  row write identical on conformant maps. `map_validate()` bounds
  *indices*, not coordinates, so this was the real memory-safety
  boundary.
- **`render.cyr` / `sprite.cyr` / `status.cyr` — bound the patch
  column decoders (F01 / F02 / F03).** `render_draw_weapon`,
  `sprite_render_all`, and the shared HUD/menu/title decoder
  `st_draw_patch_shaded` read `read_le32(buf + 8 + col*4)` and
  walked post lists with only an iteration-count `safety` guard and
  no address bounds. Each now mirrors `texture_get_column`: column
  directory bounds (`8 + col*4 + 4 > size`), `col_off >= size`, and
  per-post `post + 1 >= end` / `post + 4 + length > end` checks,
  plus a `psz < 8` header floor. `st_draw_patch_from_buf` /
  `st_draw_patch_shaded` now take the backing lump size (threaded
  from every call site in `status.cyr` + `menu.cyr`).
- **`texture.cyr` — validate `TEXTURE1` offsets + patch refs (F19).**
  `texture_init` now bounds the offset directory and each
  texture's 22-byte header against the lump (`off + 22 > t1_size`
  skips a malformed entry — the zeroed `tex_table` slot is guarded
  by the existing `tw == 0` early-out), and `texture_get_column`
  bounds every 10-byte patch reference to the lump extent
  (`tex_def_end`). Completes the patch-decode attack surface.

### Fixed

- **`render.cyr` — visible corruption on E1M1 (F17).** As a direct
  consequence of the OOB-write fix above, an 11-pixel block at
  x=234–237, y=107–109 that previously rendered as stray near-black
  speckle (from the corrupted visplane bounds) now renders the
  correct floor texture. This is the only intended pixel change in
  0.28.0; all other frames (E1M1/E1M3/E1M5 game + automap +
  intermission, title, menu, skill) are byte-identical to 0.27.5.

### Removed

- **`render.cyr` — dead `render_flat_span` (singular) deleted (F16).**
  43-line per-pixel span routine with zero call sites (superseded
  by the deferred row-based `render_flat_spans`). Output unchanged.

### Performance

- **`render.cyr` — inline the flat fill + hoist the COLORMAP row
  (F11).** `render_flat_spans` called `flat_get_pixel` (re-masking
  `& 63`) and `render_shade` (re-clamping the light level, already
  `0..31` here) for *every* floor/ceiling pixel — two calls plus
  redundant work on the dominant fill path. The fetch is now
  inlined and the COLORMAP row pointer (`colormap + light*256`) is
  hoisted per span. Byte-identical output. **`render_frame`
  ≈2.10 ms → ≈1.78 ms (~15%)**, `render_frame+sprites` ≈2.12 ms →
  ≈1.78 ms, measured same-toolchain (cycc 6.0.83) before/after
  against the 22 ms @ 35 Hz budget (now ~12× headroom).
  `texture_get_column` unchanged (~685 ns).
- **`render.cyr` — cache the weapon patch (F14).**
  `render_draw_weapon` re-read the weapon lump from the WAD via
  `wad_read_lump_into` *every frame*; now re-read only when the
  firing frame actually changes the lump (guarded after the size
  check so a rejected lump is never cached).

### Changed

- **Toolchain pin `6.0.29` → `6.0.83`** in `cyrius.cyml`. Lock
  re-resolved (canonical 27 entries, `cyrius deps --verify` 27/0).
  Codegen-identical to 6.0.29 for the unchanged sources.

Binary `590,824 → 592,456 B` (+1,632 B: the patch-decode bounds
checks, net of the `render_flat_span` deletion). DCE NOP-sled
985 fns / 293,833 B. Tests 37/37 WAD-free + 73/73 full; fuzz
`fuzz_wad` 1k + `fuzz_fixed` 50k clean.

## [0.27.5] - 2026-06-01

Post-playtest movement fixes plus the toolchain/lockfile cleanup
(pulled forward from the v0.27.6 gated slot, now that cycc's
lockfile-writer regression is fixed upstream). Two real movement
bugs: inverted strafe, and a guard that silently dropped any
cardinal-axis move.

### Fixed

- **`player.cyr` — strafe direction inverted.** With forward =
  `(cos θ, sin θ)` and turn-left incrementing the angle (CCW),
  strafe-left is facing rotated +90° = `(-sin, +cos)` and
  strafe-right is −90° = `(+sin, -cos)`. The two blocks had the
  signs reversed, so `A` strafed right and `D` left. Swapped to
  match. `W`/`S` and arrow turning were already correct.
- **`player.cyr` — cardinal-axis moves dropped.** The movement
  apply block was gated on `move_x != 0 && move_y != 0` (nested
  ifs), so any move landing on an axis — pure forward/back or
  strafe while facing due N/S/E/W — never updated position. Now
  gated on `move_x != 0 || move_y != 0`; the full diagonal move is
  tried first, then X-only / Y-only wall slide.

### Changed

- **Toolchain pin `6.0.1` → `6.0.29`** in `cyrius.cyml`. Clears
  the per-build pin-drift warning and gives CI a toolchain whose
  `cyrius deps` lockfile writer works.
- **`cyrius.lock` now canonical (27 entries)** written by
  `cyrius deps`, replacing the hand-populated 5-entry `sha256sum`
  workaround. CI's empty-lock guard is dropped — `cyrius deps
  --verify` is an unconditional gate again. Resolves known-issue
  #1. (yukti `sys_stat` dup-fn, #2, stays — gated on a yukti
  rebundle; did not fire under 6.0.29 but left tracked.)

Binary 590,696 → 590,824 B (+128 B, the cardinal-axis move
restructure; strafe swap was size-neutral).

## [0.27.4] - 2026-06-01

Framebuffer geometry fix. The live `/dev/fb0` output path assumed
the panel was exactly 320×200×32 with a 1280-byte scanline pitch
and dumped a tightly-packed RGBA block at offset 0. On any real
display this tiled the frame horizontally and collapsed it into
the top ~20–33 px band. The `--ppm` path (self-describing) was
unaffected, so headless smoke never caught it. `framebuf_init`
now queries the real geometry and `framebuf_flip` integer-scales,
centers, and blits at the true pitch/bpp.

### Fixed

- **`framebuf.cyr` — real panel geometry.** `framebuf_init` now
  issues `FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO` (0x4600) + `FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`
  (0x4602) ioctls to read `xres` / `yres` / `bits_per_pixel` /
  `line_length`, with defensive fallbacks if the driver reports
  nothing. Computes the largest integer scale that fits both axes
  and the centering letterbox offsets once at init.
- **`framebuf_flip` — correct blit.** New `framebuf_blit` helper
  integer-scales the 320×200 indexed frame into a full-screen
  scratch buffer honoring the physical pitch and bpp (32bpp
  XRGB8888 fast path via `store32`; 16bpp RGB565 fallback), then
  writes just the active band in one `write()`. Letterbox bars are
  blacked once at init and never rewritten.

### Removed

- **Dead `rgb_buf`** (256 KB) — the old flip's intermediate RGBA
  buffer. The PPM path reads `screen_buf` + `palette` directly and
  the new blit reads from `screen_buf`, so the intermediate is gone.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-05-21

`Result<T, E>` adoption at the WAD IO/parse boundary. Doom's
public-fn surface has been `: i64`-annotated since 0.27.2;
0.27.3 builds on that to retrofit typed-error returns where the
boot path needed them most. Replaces hand-coded `-1` / `0`
sentinels at the `wad_open` boundary with typed `WadError`
variants. Introduces the `?` propagation operator + exhaustive
`match` at the main-loop boundary — the first use of v5.8.x sum
types in doom's own code.

### Added

- **`enum WadError`** in `wad.cyr` — six variants
  (`WadOpenFailed` / `WadBadMagic` / `WadIoFailed` /
  `WadLumpNotFound` / `WadLumpTooBig` / `WadOther`).
  Wad-prefixed to coexist in the global enum-variant namespace
  per stdlib convention (matches `IoNotFound` / `JsonParseErr`
  / etc.).
- **`wad_read_lump_r(idx)`** — Result-returning parallel to
  `wad_read_lump`. Returns `Ok(buf_ptr)` on success;
  `Err(WadLumpNotFound)` for a bad index;
  `Err(WadIoFailed)` for a short read.
- **`wad_read_lump_into_r(idx, buf, max)`** — Result-returning
  parallel to `wad_read_lump_into`. Returns `Ok(bytes_read)`
  on success; same `Err` set as above.
- **`boot_init(wad_path)`** in `main.cyr` — Result-returning
  helper that cascades the boot-path WAD open + PLAYPAL lookup
  + PLAYPAL read via the `?` propagation operator. Replaces
  the prior inline `if (... != 0) { sakshi_error(...);
  syscall(60, 1); }` boilerplate.

### Changed

- **`wad_open(path)`** — in-place migration to
  `Result<i64, WadError>` (3 call sites total: `main.cyr`,
  `tests/doom.tcyr`, `benches/doom.bcyr`). Returns `Ok(0)` on
  success; `Err(WadOpenFailed)` if `file_open` fails;
  `Err(WadBadMagic)` if the header magic is neither `IWAD`
  nor `PWAD`; `Err(WadIoFailed)` if the header read is short.
  Removed inline `sakshi_error` calls — the typed `Err` lets
  the caller log a more informative message at the boundary
  via `match`.
- **`doom_main()`** boot path — `wad_open(argv(1)) != 0`
  inline check replaced with `var br = boot_init(argv(1)); if
  (is_err_result(br) == 1) { match load64(br + 8) { ... } }`.
  The match arm logs the typed cause (`cannot open WAD file`
  / `not a WAD file` / `WAD I/O failure` / `missing PLAYPAL
  lump` / `boot init failed`) before exiting with status 1.
  Compiler-enforced exhaustiveness via the explicit `_ =>`
  catch-all.
- **`tests/doom.tcyr`** — `wad_open` check uses `is_ok(...) ==
  1` rather than the legacy `== 0` int comparison. `alloc_init()`
  was already on the test entry path before `wad_open`, so the
  Result allocation runs safely.
- **`src/main.cyr`** banner bumped 0.27.2 → 0.27.3.

### Deferred

- **`texture.cyr` Result adoption** (roadmap item #3) —
  deferred to a follow-up cut. The wad-side adoption already
  demonstrates the full pattern (typed enum + `?` + `match`);
  texture's call sites in `render.cyr` (`texture_get_column`)
  are inside the hot render path and the existing `0`-on-fail
  sentinel is handled gracefully by the renderer, so the
  migration value is lower than wad-open's. Will revisit
  alongside the v0.28.x Black Book audit's column-rendering
  pass.

### Verified

- `cyrius build src/main.cyr build/doom`: 587,752 B (+2,528 B
  vs 0.27.2's 585,224 B — Result codegen + match jump tables +
  ?-operator emit. 985 unreachable fns / 291,438 B NOPed).
- `cyrius deps --verify`: 5 verified, 0 failed.
- `cyrius test tests/doom.tcyr` (WAD-free): 37/37 passed.
- `./build/test_doom wad/DOOM1.WAD` (full): 73/73 passed.
- `./build/doom wad/DOOM1.WAD --ppm`: E1M1 + automap +
  intermission PPMs at 192,015 B each; map summary unchanged.
- **Typed-error paths verified** by injecting bad inputs:
  - `./build/doom /nonexistent.wad` → `[ERROR] cannot open
    WAD file` (matches `WadOpenFailed` arm).
  - `./build/doom /etc/hostname` → `[ERROR] not a WAD file`
    (matches `WadBadMagic` arm — the file opens but has no
    IWAD/PWAD magic).
- Bench (`scripts/bench-history.sh`): `render_frame` 2.132 ms /
  `+sprites` 2.136 ms / `fixed_mul` 6 ns / `texture_get_column`
  749 ns / `pcache_get_hit` 8 ns — variance-level vs 0.27.2
  (2.114 / 2.127 / 6 / 730 / 7). Result allocations land at
  boot only (boot_init's `Ok(0)` + `Ok(pd)`), not on the hot
  render path — no per-frame allocation pressure.

### Known issues (unchanged from 0.27.0–0.27.2)

Both upstream-cycc workarounds still apply. Tracked under
v0.27.5 upstream-fix cleanup.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-05-21

Type-annotation sweep across doom's full public-fn surface —
adopts the v5.11.x annotation arc (parse-only `: i64` return-type
annotation, zero codegen change) on every fn in `src/*.cyr`,
matching the shape of vani's 0.9.3 internal sweep and bsp's
1.2.x planned cut. 269 single-line fn signatures + 1 multi-line
(`render_store_masked`) bumped to carry an explicit `: i64`
return tag. Documents return contracts inline; sets up
0.27.3's `Result<T, E>` adoption to retrofit error-bearing
returns without further signature churn at the call sites.

### Changed

- **`: i64` return annotations across all 20 modules in
  `src/*.cyr`** — 270 fn signatures total. Includes
  `render_transform_vertex` (multi-return tuple), which the
  annotation accepts as parse-only metadata since cycc 6.0.1
  treats `: i64` as a documentation hint without enforcing it
  against tuple-shaped returns. Highest-value boundaries
  (`wad` / `map` / `render` / `texture`) carry annotations
  same as every other module — no tiered rollout was needed
  because the sweep is mechanical and parse-only.
- **`src/main.cyr`** — banner string `cyrius-doom v0.27.1` →
  `cyrius-doom v0.27.2`. `load_map()` and `doom_main()` both
  annotated as `: i64` (the actual return values: 0 / -1 for
  load_map; doom_main exits via `syscall(60, …)` so its return
  is conventionally i64).

### Verified

- **Binary byte-identical**: 585,224 → 585,224 B. Confirms the
  annotation pass produces zero codegen delta. Matches vani
  0.9.3's "ABI-identical" claim under the same v5.11.x arc.
- `cyrius build src/main.cyr build/doom`: 585,224 B (982
  unreachable fns / 292,798 B NOPed — same as 0.27.1).
- `cyrius deps --verify`: 5 verified, 0 failed.
- `cyrius test tests/doom.tcyr` (WAD-free): 37/37 passed.
- `./build/test_doom wad/DOOM1.WAD` (full): 73/73 passed.
- `./build/doom wad/DOOM1.WAD --ppm`: E1M1 + automap +
  intermission PPMs 192,015 B each; map summary unchanged.
- Bench (`scripts/bench-history.sh`): `render_frame` 2.114 ms
  / `+sprites` 2.127 ms / `fixed_mul` 6 ns / `texture_get_column`
  730 ns / `pcache_get_hit` 7 ns — all within run-to-run
  variance of the 0.27.1 row (2.146 / 2.141 / 7 / 761 / 8).
  Annotations do not move frame time, as predicted.

### Known issues (unchanged from 0.27.0 / 0.27.1)

Both upstream-cycc workarounds still apply. Tracked under
v0.27.5 upstream-fix cleanup:

- `cyrius.lock` written empty by `cyrius deps` — hand-populated
  via `sha256sum`.
- `lib/yukti.cyr:39: duplicate fn 'sys_stat' (last definition
  wins)` — codegen-identical.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-21

bsp 1.1.3 + vani 0.9.4 dep-tag re-pin — the half of the 0.27.0
cut that was held against upstream-publish. No source changes
in `src/*.cyr` beyond the version comments in `src/main.cyr`'s
header and the banner string; both upstream tags ship bundle
content byte-identical to their predecessor save for the
`Version:` header line. Same shape as v0.26.1's Cyrius pin-only
patch.

### Changed

- **`[deps.bsp]` 1.1.2 → 1.1.3** — picks up bsp's cyrius
  toolchain pin bump (5.5.2 → 6.0.1), `${file:VERSION}`
  template, `cyrius.toml` + `.cyrius-toolchain` retirement,
  and CI lift to the patra-style installer. `dist/bsp.cyr`
  bundle content is byte-identical save for the `Version:`
  header (1.1.2 → 1.1.3).
- **`[deps.vani]` 0.9.3 → 0.9.4** — picks up vani's cyrius
  pin bump (5.11.4 → 6.0.1), yukti 2.2.2 → 2.2.4, patra
  1.9.3 → 1.9.5, and `cc5_aarch64 → cycc_aarch64` CI rename.
  `dist/vani-core.cyr` bundle content is byte-identical save
  for the `Version:` header.
- **`src/main.cyr`** — vendored-dep version comments bumped
  (`bsp @ 1.1.1` → `bsp @ 1.1.3`, `vani @ 0.9.1` → `vani @
  0.9.4`); these two comments had lagged through 0.27.0).
  Banner string `cyrius-doom v0.27.0` → `cyrius-doom v0.27.1`.
- **`cyrius.lock`** — re-anchored to the new bundle hashes:
  `lib/vani-core.cyr` `9891f720… → 74000d17…`, `lib/bsp.cyr`
  `… → 8ae89a9e…`. Yukti / patra / sakshi hashes also rotate
  as vani's transitive dep tree resolved fresh.
- **Binary size**: 585,320 → **585,224 B (−96 B)**. The delta
  is the `Version:` header swap in the two bundles
  (`# Version: 0.9.3` → `# Version: 0.9.4`, `# Version: 1.1.2`
  → `# Version: 1.1.3`). Variance-level, not a real shrink —
  recovery to ~260 KB remains gated on Cyrius O3 real DCE.

### Verified

- `cyrius deps`: 5 resolved (after hand-populating `cyrius.lock`
  via `sha256sum`, same cycc 6.0.1 lockfile-writer workaround
  documented under 0.27.0 Known issues).
- `cyrius deps --verify`: 5 verified, 0 failed.
- `cyrius build src/main.cyr build/doom`: 585,224 B (982
  unreachable fns / 292,798 B NOPed).
- `cyrius test tests/doom.tcyr` (WAD-free): 37/37 passed.
- `./build/test_doom wad/DOOM1.WAD` (full): 73/73 passed.
- `./build/doom wad/DOOM1.WAD --ppm`: E1M1 + automap +
  intermission PPMs all written at the expected 192,015 B
  each; map summary `V=467 L=475 SD=648 S=85 SG=732 SS=237
  N=236 T=138` matches 0.27.0 / 0.26.2.
- Bench (`scripts/bench-history.sh`): `render_frame` 2.146 ms,
  `render_frame+sprites` 2.141 ms, `fixed_mul` 7 ns,
  `texture_get_column` 761 ns, `pcache_get_hit` 8 ns — all
  within run-to-run variance of 0.27.0's pre-publish numbers.

### Known issues (carried over from 0.27.0)

Both upstream-cycc workarounds documented under 0.27.0 still
apply unchanged in 0.27.1:

- `cyrius.lock` written empty by `cyrius deps` — workaround:
  hand-populate via `sha256sum lib/{vani-core,bsp,yukti,patra,
  sakshi}.cyr > cyrius.lock`. CI's `--verify` step stays
  gated on a populated lockfile.
- `lib/yukti.cyr:39: duplicate fn 'sys_stat' (last definition
  wins)` — codegen-identical, drops when yukti drops the
  duplicate from its dist. Pending tracked under 0.27.5
  upstream-fix cleanup.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-21

Cyrius 6.0.1 lift + manifest modernization. Opens the 0.27.x
patch arc — held against the Cyrius O4 linear-scan regalloc
landing for the "performance pass" was the original 0.27.0 thesis,
but the v6.0.0 cycle-open (cybs/cycc rename) + the v5.8.x sum-type
/ `Result<T,E>` / `?` / exhaustive-match infrastructure that's
now landed in stdlib makes a `language-adoption` arc the higher-
value 0.27.x sequence. O4 perf-pass re-targets to 0.28.x once
the upstream regalloc ships. The 0.27.x patches now sequence as:
0.27.0 cyrius lift + manifest, 0.27.1 bsp/vani dep-tag re-pin
(post-publish), 0.27.2 type annotations on public surface, 0.27.3
`Result<T,E>` adoption in `wad.cyr` / `render.cyr` error paths,
0.27.4 `lib/test.cyr` table-driven test refactor.

### Changed

- **Cyrius 5.7.48 → 6.0.1**. Covers the v5.8.x language arc
  (`Result<T,E>` carve-out into `lib/result.cyr` at v5.8.28,
  sum-type syntax / `enum Foo { Bar(T); }` at v5.8.21,
  `?` operator + exhaustive-match warnings at v5.8.21-25), the
  v5.9.x stdlib enrichment, the v5.11.x annotation arc
  (`fn foo(): i64` return types — parse-only, zero-codegen-change),
  v5.11.59 DCE-aware undef-fn reachability filter (cleaner
  compiler warnings), v5.11.60 `_exec3` argv/envp byte-contract
  fix in `lib/process.cyr`, v5.11.65 CVE-05 tok_names mangle-path
  overflow fix in the compiler itself, v6.0.0 two-binary rename
  ceremony (`cyrc → cybs`, `cc5 → cycc`; ~2,100 occurrences
  across cyrius repo), and v6.0.1 stdlib-resolution path hotfixes
  (the rename-skip off-by-one that shipped `ud2/ud2/nop` sentinels
  to UEFI consumers — fixed same-day).
- **Binary growth**: 565,856 → 585,320 B (**+19,464 B, +3.4 %**)
  on cycc 6.0.1. Honest growth-tax from the v5.11.x annotation
  rt-table widening + v5.8.x sum-type emit. Cyrius's own
  v6.0.x byte-array-literal-peephole + dead-code careful sweep
  are expected to recover a portion; the long-deferred O3 real
  DCE recovery to ~260 KB still gates on upstream. Frame time
  unchanged (~3.9 ms/frame on E1M1).
- **Manifest hygiene** (matches patra/vani/sakshi/mihi
  convention):
  - **`cyrius.toml` + `cyrb.toml` deleted.** `cyrius.cyml` is
    now the single manifest, matching every other modern
    first-party lib. The legacy `.toml` shims existed during
    the 5.x cyml transition; v6.0.0 closed that transition.
  - **`version = "${file:VERSION}"` template** in `cyrius.cyml`
    — version single-source-of-truth at `VERSION`. CI's
    consistency check now resolves the template (same pattern
    patra/vani CI use).
- **`[deps.vani]` 0.9.1 → 0.9.3** — picks up vani's stdlib
  annotation pass (`: i64` return-type annotations on every
  public fn in vani's `src/*.cyr` — parse-only, ABI-identical).
  Vendored `dist/vani-core.cyr` still 800 lines, same 22
  `audio_*` symbols, header bumped 0.9.1 → 0.9.3.
- **CI workflows refreshed**:
  - Adopted patra's pre-flight HTTP check on the Cyrius release
    asset — surfaces a clear error when the cyml pin is bumped
    ahead of the published release (catches the failure pattern
    documented in patra v1.9.0 CI fix).
  - Version-pinned toolchain install layout
    (`~/.cyrius/versions/$V/{bin,lib}/`) — required by cycc
    6.0.1's stdlib resolver, matches every other modern repo.
  - `${file:VERSION}` template resolution in the
    version-consistency check.
  - `cyrius deps --verify` gated on a populated lockfile
    (cycc 6.0.1 has a known regression where `cyrius deps`
    writes an empty `cyrius.lock` for some manifest shapes
    incl. ours — workaround documented inline, drops when the
    upstream fix lands).
  - `cyrius.toml` removed from the required-docs check.
- **`cyrius.lock` re-anchored** for the new vani 0.9.3 dist
  hash (`9891f720…` vs prior `aaa8fba9…`). bsp 1.1.2 dist
  hash unchanged.
- **`src/main.cyr` banner** bumped 0.26.2 → 0.27.0.

### Known issues (downstream)

- `warning:lib/yukti.cyr:39: duplicate fn 'sys_stat' (last
  definition wins)` — cycc 6.0.1's bundled
  `lib/syscalls_x86_64_linux.cyr` defines `sys_stat(path, buf):
  i64`; vani's transitively-bundled yukti 2.2.4 dist defines
  `sys_stat(path, buf)` without the annotation. The two
  implementations are byte-identical at the codegen layer
  (yukti's wins). Drops when yukti re-bundles with the cyrius
  stdlib sys_stat dropped from its own surface — out of scope
  for cyrius-doom.
- `warning: cyrius.lock: 0 deps locked` — cycc 6.0.1
  lockfile-writer regression (acknowledged upstream, fix
  pending). Workaround: this repo's `cyrius.lock` is populated
  by hand (`sha256sum lib/{vani-core,bsp,yukti,patra,sakshi}.cyr`)
  so `cyrius deps --verify` still succeeds locally; CI gates
  the verify step on a populated lock so it doesn't trivially
  pass against a freshly-empty resolver write.

### Verified

- `cyrius deps --verify`: 5 verified, 0 failed.
- `cyrius build src/main.cyr build/doom`: 585,320 B (CYRIUS_DCE=1
  identical, 987 unreachable fns / 290,955 B NOPed).
- `cyrius test tests/doom.tcyr`: 37/37 passed (WAD-free subset).
- `./build/doom wad/DOOM1.WAD --ppm`: E1M1 + automap + intermission
  PPMs all written; map summary `V=467 L=475 SD=648 S=85 SG=732
  SS=237 N=236 T=138` matches 0.26.2.
- `bsp 1.1.3` (pinned in `[deps.bsp]` once published): 79/79
  tests, 13/13 benches sub-μs, 25K fuzz iters across 3 harnesses
  — same gates, growth-tax of +18,144 B in standalone bsp binary
  (76,496 → 94,640 B) from cyrius 6.0.1.

### Pending (queued for 0.27.1)

- **`[deps.bsp]` 1.1.2 → 1.1.3** + **`[deps.vani]` 0.9.3 → 0.9.4**
  — both upstream tags carry only the cyrius pin bump (5.5.2 →
  6.0.1 for bsp; 5.11.4 → 6.0.1 for vani) and CI-yml rename
  (`cc5_aarch64` → `cycc_aarch64`). The bundle content for
  `dist/bsp.cyr` and `dist/vani-core.cyr` is byte-identical to
  the current 1.1.2 / 0.9.3 pin (only the `Version:` header
  differs). 0.27.1 rolls forward once the user tags + publishes.

## [0.26.2] - 2026-05-01

Toolchain + audio-stack hygiene cut. Unblocks CI (vani 0.9.x
requires Cyrius 5.7.48 stdlib surface, but `.cyrius-toolchain`
was still pinned at 5.5.2), opts cyrius-doom into vani's new
`audio-core` distribution profile (29 KB single-module bundle
vs the 76 KB full bundle, 22 `audio_*` symbols vs 106), and
collapses the manifest drift between `cyrius.cyml` /
`cyrius.toml` / `cyrb.toml`. No source behavior changes — the
`audio_*` ABI is byte-identical between vani profiles, and
`src/audio.cyr` calls exactly six of the 22 core-profile
symbols.

### Changed

- **Cyrius 5.5.2 → 5.7.48** — `cyrius.cyml` and `cyrius.toml`
  pinned to 5.7.48. The CI break was caused by `cyrius.cyml`
  declaring `cyrius = "5.7.48"` (required by vani 0.9.x's
  manifest, which references stdlib modules `fs` / `hashmap` /
  `tagged` / `fnptr` / `freelist` / `process` / `patra` that
  didn't ship in the 5.5.2 stdlib bundle) while the toolchain
  installer file CI was reading (`.cyrius-toolchain`) was
  still 5.5.2.
- **`.cyrius-toolchain` deleted.** CI now reads the pinned
  toolchain from `cyrius.cyml`'s `cyrius = "..."` line via
  `grep -oP '(?<=^cyrius = ")[^"]+' cyrius.cyml` — the same
  pattern vani / yukti CI uses. Single source of truth
  eliminates the drift vector that caused this CI break.
- **vani 0.3.0 → 0.9.1 (`core` profile)** — `[deps.vani]` now
  pins `tag = "0.9.1"` with `modules = ["dist/vani-core.cyr"]`
  (was `"dist/vani.cyr"`). The core profile is a strict subset
  of the full bundle: only `src/alsa.cyr`'s `audio_*` shim,
  29,015 B / 800 lines / 22 public symbols. cyrius-doom's
  `src/audio.cyr` calls 6 of those 22 — every other vani
  module (`buffer` / `capture` / `device` / `error` /
  `format` / `mixer` / `playback`) is dropped at the bundle
  level, not just at the dead-code level. The `audio_*` ABI
  is byte-identical between profiles, so `src/audio.cyr` is
  unchanged.
- **`src/main.cyr` include** swapped `lib/vani.cyr` →
  `lib/vani-core.cyr` to match the new manifest path. Header
  comment refreshed to point at vani 0.9.1 and to call out
  that the full `vani_*` higher-level helpers are still one
  manifest line away if a later sound rework wants them.
- **Manifest hygiene**:
  - `cyrius.toml` and `cyrb.toml` synced to `cyrius.cyml`'s
    canonical `[deps]` shape: stdlib list drops the retired
    `audio` (5.8.0) and adds `fs` / `hashmap` / `tagged` /
    `fnptr` / `freelist` / `process` / `sakshi` to cover
    vani's transitive needs.
  - **`patra` dropped from stdlib** — vani's `[deps.patra] @
    1.9.2` git override provides it transitively, and listing
    it in both places triggered double-resolution (the cc5
    deps writer can't reconcile a stdlib copy + a git symlink
    for the same `lib/` path). Mirrors what vani did
    internally to its own stdlib list at 0.9.0. CI surfaced
    this as `error: cannot write lib/patra.cyr`.
  - `cyrb.toml`'s stale `[deps.shravan]` (2.0.0, never used
    in this branch) replaced by `[deps.vani] @ 0.9.1`.
  - **`lib/` no longer committed.** Was tracked as a mix of
    real stdlib copies (mode 100644) and symlinks to the
    local developer's `/home/<user>/.cyrius/...` (mode 120000)
    — the symlinks were dangling on every CI runner. Now
    fully gitignored (`/lib/` in `.gitignore`, matching vani
    / yukti); `cyrius deps` populates it fresh on every
    checkout. 18 previously-tracked files dropped from the
    index.

### CI alignment with vani / yukti

- **Toolchain version sourced from `cyrius.cyml`** instead of
  the now-deleted `.cyrius-toolchain` file. Same `grep -oP`
  pattern vani uses. Applies to both `ci.yml` and
  `release.yml`.
- **`Lock file present` step** added before `cyrius deps` —
  guards against accidental `.gitignore` changes that would
  let `cyrius.lock` slip out of git, defeating the
  supply-chain integrity check.
- **`cyrius deps --verify` step** added after `cyrius deps`
  in both `build` and `test` jobs. Verifies the lockfile
  hashes match the just-resolved `lib/` contents — catches
  upstream tag rewrites and dep tampering.
- **Version-consistency check** in the `docs` job now
  cross-checks `VERSION` against `cyrius.cyml`,
  `cyrius.toml`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Stops a release from
  shipping with version drift.

### Binary size — honest read

| Build | `build/doom` | Δ |
|---|---|---|
| 0.26.1 (vani 0.3.0, full) | 259,920 B | baseline |
| 0.26.2 mid-bump (vani 0.9.0, full) | 600,608 B | +340,688 B |
| **0.26.2 final (vani 0.9.1, core)** | **565,856 B** | **+305,936 B vs 0.26.1, −34,752 B vs full** |

Trimming vani's bundled source from 76 KB → 29 KB (47 KB
delta) translates to a ~35 KB binary savings — about 5.8 % off
the full-bundle build. The remaining ~306 KB of regression vs.
0.26.1 is unreachable today: every public symbol vani exports
gets a NOPped function body in the cyrius-doom output under
the current cc5 NOP-sled DCE. Real recovery to ~260 KB lands
when **Cyrius phase O3 (real DCE replaces NOP-sled)** ships,
at which point the core profile's smaller surface compounds
with O3 to drop the unused `audio_*` getters and the
capture-side path entirely.

The proposal that drove the audio-core profile predicted
"~340 KB recovered"; that prediction was overstated for the
same DCE reason. The mechanism works as designed; the size
win is bottlenecked on Cyrius, not on vani. See
`docs/proposals/archive/vani-audio-core-profile.md` for the
full closing-loop analysis.

### Audio dep — transitional shape

`vani` is **not** the long-term audio dep for cyrius-doom.
The current trajectory:

1. **vani** (today, 0.9.1 core) — covers the gap left by the
   cyrius stdlib `audio` retirement (5.8.0 fold-in). Stable
   `audio_*` shim, byte-stable ABI, single-module 29 KB
   bundle. Good enough until dhvani lands.
2. **dhvani** (planned) — Rust-to-Cyrius port. Will replace
   vani in `[deps.*]` once the port hits feature parity for
   the playback path cyrius-doom uses. Same `audio_*` shape
   is the migration target so `src/audio.cyr` stays
   ABI-stable across the swap.

Treat vani's surface in cyrius-doom as a temporary pin, not a
long-term commitment. The audio-core profile choice was made
specifically with this swap in mind: the smaller the vani
surface, the smaller the dhvani port's day-one feature target.

### Documentation

- **Audio-core proposal**, drafted, accepted, and archived at
  `docs/proposals/archive/vani-audio-core-profile.md`. Includes
  the original three-cut patch-series proposal (0.9.1 → 0.9.2 →
  0.9.3) that vani collapsed into a single 0.9.1 cut, the
  resolution section, and the closing-loop measurement
  (565,856 B post-flip). First entry under
  `docs/proposals/archive/`; future settled proposals will
  land alongside it.

### Gates

- `cyrius deps`: 5/5 resolved, `cyrius.lock` rewritten clean.
- `cyrius build src/main.cyr build/doom`: OK (565,856 B).
- `cyrius test tests/doom.tcyr`: 37/37 WAD-free assertions
  pass (CI's headless subset). Full 73-assertion suite needs a
  WAD path; not exercised in CI by design.
- `./build/doom wad/DOOM1.WAD --ppm`: E1M1, automap, and
  intermission render cleanly. ALSA path emits the expected
  `[WARN] audio: no device` on the headless CI runner, no
  device under `/dev/snd/`.

### Tracking the upstream optimizer track

Unchanged from 0.26.1 — cyrius-doom still holds v0.27.0
"performance pass" against Cyrius O4 linear-scan regalloc
landing. The 0.26.2 toolchain bump (5.5.2 → 5.7.48) does not
include any of O2 / O3 / O4 — those are scheduled in the
parallel cyrius optimizer queue, not in the 5.7.x stabilization
line.

The honest-read above on binary size is the most concrete
demonstration to date of why O3 matters: a clean 47 KB
source-bundle trim recovered only ~35 KB of binary, because
~306 KB of `0x90` filler is structurally trapped behind the
NOP-sled DCE. O3 unlocks it as a free win.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Cyrius 5.5.0 → 5.5.2** — picks up the enum-constant `sc_num`
  fold that shipped in 5.5.1 (PE syscall reroutes) + 5.5.2 (the
  actual fold). Every enum variant read now emits `mov rax, imm32`
  (5 B) instead of `mov rcx, gvaddr; mov rax, [rcx]` (~10 B).
  cyrius-doom is enum-dense (`MapMax`, `MapSize`, `MapLineFlag`,
  `MapMisc`, `Fixed`, `Angle`, `ViewConst`, `WeaponConst`,
  `BspFixed`, `BspNode`, `BBox`, `BlockmapConst`, …), so the win
  compounds across the codebase.
- **BSP 1.1.1 → 1.1.2** — bsp's own toolchain pin bumped, same
  enum-fold benefit on its standalone build.
- **Binary shrink**: 267,216 B (on 5.5.0) → **259,920 B (on 5.5.2)** —
  **−7,296 B (−2.7 %)** purely from the 5.5.2 enum fold, no code
  changes in cyrius-doom. bsp standalone: 77,944 → 76,496 B
  (−1,448 B, −1.86 %).
- **Benches on 5.5.2**: `fixed_mul` 4 ns, `pcache_get_hit` 9 ns,
  `atan2` 13 ns, `point_on_side` 29 ns, `render_frame` 2.53 ms —
  within run-to-run variance of 0.26.0 numbers (the enum fold is
  a codegen-size win, not a runtime-hot-path win).

### Gates

- 9/9 shareware maps render (via bsp library traversal).
- 73/73 tests pass; 50K + 1K fuzz iters clean.
- fmt + lint clean across all 20 cyrius-doom modules and vendored
  lib/bsp.cyr.

### Tracking the upstream optimizer track

Cyrius's parallel O1–O6 compiler-optimization queue (see
`cyrius/docs/development/roadmap.md` §"v5.4.x Queue"). The 5.5.2
fold is a narrow peephole-class win that doesn't touch the hot
runtime path; the larger wins for cyrius-doom arrive with:

- **Phase O2** (peephole: strength reduction, flag reuse, LEA
  combining, aarch64 `madd`/`msub`): small runtime wins on hot
  loops. Incrementally.
- **Phase O3** (IR-driven DCE + const prop + dead-store elim):
  **real** DCE replaces today's NOP-sled — binary actually
  shrinks instead of staying 260 KB with 49 KB of `0x90` filler.
- **Phase O4** (linear-scan register allocator): the one that
  matters. 2–3× on hot inner loops per Poletto-Sarkar; will
  unlock a v0.27.0 "performance pass" release targeting sub-
  millisecond `render_frame`.

No hand-optimization of `fx_mul` / `asr` / column loops until
O2–O4 land — the compiler will do it uniformly and avoid
fighting the codegen.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added — bsp is a real dep

Turned the "Composes: bsp" line from aspirational into mechanical truth.
Prior versions rolled their own BSP traversal in `render.cyr` +
`src/map.cyr`; 0.26.0 vendors bsp 1.1.1's single-file distribution and
calls into the library.

- **Manifest migrated to `cyrius.cyml`** (5.x convention, modelled on
  `libro/cyrius.cyml`). `cyrius.toml` kept alongside as a build-tool
  compatibility shim during the transition.
- **`[deps.bsp]`** pinned to `tag = "1.1.1"`, `modules = ["dist/bsp.cyr"]`.
  The Cyrius build tool symlinks `lib/bsp.cyr` →
  `~/.cyrius/deps/bsp/1.1.1/dist/bsp.cyr`, so the vendored copy stays in
  sync with upstream.
- **`lib/bsp.cyr` included first** in `main.cyr`, `tests/doom.tcyr`, and
  `benches/doom.bcyr` — before `src/fixed.cyr`, which now shares bsp's
  `asr()` (stripped the duplicate definition; they were identical).

### Changed — ad-hoc BSP primitives → bsp library calls

- **`src/render.cyr`** — `render_bsp_node` now calls `bsp_is_subsector` /
  `bsp_subsector_idx` / `bsp_point_on_side(map_nodes, ...)` /
  `bsp_node_child_r(map_nodes, ...)` / `bsp_node_child_l(map_nodes, ...)`.
  Layout-compatible: cyrius-doom's 112-byte node block has identical
  field offsets to bsp's.
- **`src/player.cyr`** — `player_find_sector`'s BSP walk likewise.
- **`src/sprite.cyr`** — sprite's floor-lookup BSP walk likewise.
- **`src/map.cyr`** — deleted `map_point_on_side`, `map_is_subsector`,
  `map_subsector_idx`, and the `map_node_{x,y,dx,dy,child_r,child_l}`
  accessors. Kept `MAP_NODE_SIZE = 112` for the loader's alloc sizing;
  noted the layout-match with `BSP_NODE_SIZE` in a comment.
- **`benches/doom.bcyr`** `point_on_side` bench switched to
  `bsp_point_on_side`.

### Benchmarks (on Cyrius 5.5.0, bsp 1.1.1)

| Metric | 0.24.6 | 0.26.0 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `render_frame` avg | 2.73 ms | 2.50 ms | **−8.4%** |
| `render_frame+sprites` avg | 2.113 ms | 2.53 ms | ~flat |
| `point_on_side` | 23 ns | 30 ns | +7 ns (explicit `nodes` arg) |
| `fixed_mul` / `asr` / `pcache_hit` | 4 / 4 / 9 ns | 4 / 4 / 9 ns | unchanged |

The render_frame win is cache/layout: one shared `asr()` definition
instead of two, and consolidated node-access through bsp's accessor
pattern. The +7 ns on `point_on_side` is the cost of passing `map_nodes`
explicitly — trivially compensated for by the render_frame win since the
BSP walk hits it ~N_nodes times per frame but other path code benefits
from the uniformity.

### Gates

- Build: OK, binary 259,920 bytes.
- 9/9 shareware maps render (E1M1–E1M9) via the bsp traversal.
- Tests: 73/73 (`build/test_doom wad/DOOM1.WAD`).
- Fuzz: `fuzz_fixed` 50K iters + `fuzz_wad` 1K iters pass.
- Lint: clean across all 20 cyrius-doom modules.
- Fmt: `src/render.cyr` formatted-in-place (pre-existing multi-line arg
  indentation nits cc5's formatter wanted normalized).

## [0.24.6] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **E1M6 map load** — `MAP_MAX_SSECTORS` raised 512 → 1024. E1M6 ("Central Processing") has 606 subsectors; prior cap truncated loading and left node child indices dangling, so `map_validate()` correctly rejected the map. Latent since the v0.24.0 validator shipped — the "all 9 maps render" claim in 0.24.x was inaccurate (test suite only exercised E1M1). All 9 shareware maps now render.
- **tests/doom.tcyr missing includes** — `input.cyr`, `player.cyr`, and `things.cyr` added. Cyrius 5.5.0 hardens undefined-variable references into compile errors (previously soft-warn), so the incomplete include chain now fails loudly at `cyrius test`. `./build/test_doom wad/DOOM1.WAD` → 73/73 pass.

### Changed

- **Cyrius 5.5.0** — toolchain bump from 4.8.5-1. No source changes required for language compatibility. cyrius.toml + .cyrius-toolchain + main.cyr banner updated.
- **BSP 1.1.0** — sibling dep upgraded on 5.5.0. Signed-shift correctness audit: `asr()` replaces bare `>>` on signed values across `aabb_center_*`, `bsp_point_seg_dist`, and both `frustum_test_*` functions. DOOM wasn't biting these because integer-fx coords aligned the low bits; non-DOOM consumers would have. 79/79 tests (+5 regression asserts), 25K fuzz iters still pass, benches unchanged. cyrius-doom references bumped to 1.1.0 in CLAUDE.md + cyrb.toml.
- **Binary size**: 248976 bytes (~243 KB). Essentially flat vs 0.24.5.
- **Benchmarks on 5.5.0** (100 iters render_frame):
  - `fixed_mul` 4ns, `fixed_div` 3ns, `asr` 4ns, `sin_lookup` 4ns (unchanged)
  - `atan2` 13ns, `pcache_get_hit` 9ns (was 10ns), `colormap_shade` 4ns
  - `render_frame` avg 2.73ms, `render_frame+sprites` avg 2.113ms (well under 22ms budget)
- **Fuzz**: `fuzz_fixed` 50000 iterations OK, `fuzz_wad` 1000 iterations OK.

## [0.24.5] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Cyrius 4.8.5-1** — pinned cyrius.toml minimum. All 9 maps render, 51K fuzz iterations pass, BSP 74/74 tests green. Note: `render_frame` showed 2.59 → 2.92ms on this run (run-to-run variance, not a regression — hot math path unchanged at 4ns fixed_mul, pcache_hit improved 12 → 10ns).

## [0.24.4] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Cyrius 4.8.2** — cyrius.toml pinned to 4.8.2 minimum. Switch jump-table tuning (density 33%, range cap 1024) makes more cases eligible for O(1) dispatch.
- **Switch conversions for hot paths** — converted 4 if-chains to switch statements. Compiler decides jump-table vs chain per cluster:
  - `player_current_ammo()` — 7-case weapon → ammo-type lookup (range 1-7, dense, jump-table qualifies)
  - `player_try_fire()` — 7-case weapon → fire+deduct (same structure)
  - `thing_classify()` — weapon type (2001-2006, dense 6-case)
  - `things_check_pickups()` — unified 21-case pickup dispatch with keys (5-13), weapons (2001-2006), items (2007-2019), ammo boxes (2046-2049). Armor stays in if-chain (has conditional logic).

### Performance

- **render_frame: 2.66ms → 2.59ms** (2.6% faster)
- **render_frame+sprites: 2.76ms → 2.63ms** (4.7% faster)
- Hot-path dispatch is now measurably cheaper on per-tick item pickup checks

## [0.24.3] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Cyrius 4.6.2** — rebuilt and verified on the new toolchain. Added `cyrius = "4.6.2"` pin + `language = "cyrius"` to cyrius.toml. No code changes. All 9 maps render, 51K fuzz iterations pass.
- **BSP 1.0.1** — dep tag bumped (also rebuilt on 4.6.2, no code changes). 74/74 tests pass.
- Minor benchmark improvements: `atan2` 17ns → 13ns, `colormap_shade` 6ns → 4ns, `pcache_get_hit` 13ns → 12ns. DCE report smaller (32KB → 26KB of dead stdlib — compiler got smarter about reachability).

## [0.24.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **BSP 1.0.0** — bsp dependency stable release. API unchanged from 0.9.0. Indicates production-ready status.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **`&&` / `||` short-circuit cleanup** — now that Cyrius 4.4.1 fixed short-circuit semantics, converted nested `if (a) { if (b) { ... } }` patterns to `if (a && b) { ... }` across 9 files. 15+ sites cleaned: WAD magic check (4-level nest → 1 line), sky name check, near-plane clip, walk-over crossing, player collision ceiling/floor checks, screen bounds, armor pickup conditions, level coord parsing. Same semantics, half the lines.
- **Cyrius 4.4.3 verified** — cc3 reports 196 unreachable fns (32KB dead stdlib). `CYRIUS_DCE=1` NOPs 17KB. Clean `cyrlint` across all 20 files.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-13

### Security (CVE Audit Hardening)

- **C1: Map index bounds validation** — added `map_validate()` that runs after `map_load()`. Checks all cross-references: seg v1/v2 < num_vertexes, seg linedef < num_linedefs, linedef v1/v2 < num_vertexes, sidedef sector < num_sectors, subsector firstseg+numsegs <= num_segs, node child indices in range (with subsector flag handling). Returns -1 on any invalid index.
- **C2: Texture column bounds** — patch cache now stores per-slot lump size (`PCACHE_SLOT_SIZE` 8200→8208). `texture_get_column()` validates column header offset and column data offset within lump bounds. Post iteration loop checks `post_ptr < pdata_end` and `post_ptr + 4 + length <= pdata_end` before reading.
- **C3: BLOCKMAP offset validation** — stores `map_bm_size` at load time. Collision code validates cell offset index and list offset within blockmap lump before dereferencing. `ptr + 2 <= bm_end` checked per linedef read.
- **H1: WAD lump read zero-fill** — `wad_read_lump()` and `wad_read_lump_into()` now `memset(buf, 0, size)` before `file_read()`. Partial reads leave zeroed data instead of uninitialized memory. Warns on size mismatch.
- **H2: Sprite minimum lump size** — `sprite_render_all()` rejects sprite lumps < 8 bytes (minimum patch header size) before reading dimensions.

### Added

- `map_validate()` — post-load cross-reference validator for all map data structures
- `pcache_data_size()` — returns cached patch lump size for bounds checking
- `map_bm_size` global — blockmap lump size for runtime bounds checking
- `docs/audit/2026-04-13-security-cve-audit.md` — full CVE audit report with 15 findings

### Changed

- Binary size: 194KB (validation code adds ~3KB)
- Audit status: 3 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH → all fixed. 5 MITIGATED unchanged. 5 N/A.

## [0.23.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Terminal iflag bitmask** — `input_enable_raw_mode()` used wrong mask (-1043) to clear termios c_iflag bits. Corrected to -1331 which properly clears IXON(0x400), ICRNL(0x100), BRKINT(0x002), INPCK(0x010), ISTRIP(0x020). Pre-existing bug since v0.5.0, found during P(-1) hardening audit.

### Changed

- P(-1) hardening audit: all 20 source files verified clean. No malformed compound assignments, no broken unary minus, no buffer overflows, no unguarded divisions. One pre-existing termios bug found and fixed.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Cyrius 4.0.0 modernization** — ~300 line changes across 19 source files. All `i = i + 1` → `i += 1` compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `|=`, `&=`). All `0 - N` → `-N` negative literals. All `0 - var` → `-var` unary minus. Minimum compiler: cc3 4.0.0.
- Binary size: 191KB (slightly smaller — negative literals generate tighter code)

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Weapon bob** — sine-based weapon oscillation during player movement. X sways left-right, Y bounces vertically. 15-unit angular step per tick through 1024-entry sine table. Settles to center when stationary. BOB_RANGE = 4 pixels.
- **Sound effect triggers** — all PC speaker sounds now wired to gameplay: pistol/shotgun/chaingun fire, door open, item pickup, player pain, monster pain/death, rocket explosion. Sound plays through existing tone queue system.
- **Armor damage absorption** — `player_take_damage()` splits damage between armor and health. Green armor (≤100) absorbs 1/3, blue armor (>100) absorbs 1/2. Armor depletes before health takes full damage.
- **HUD current weapon ammo** — big AMMO number now shows current weapon's ammo type via `player_current_ammo()`. Fist/chainsaw display 0. Shotgun shows shells, rocket shows rockets, etc.

### Changed

- Binary size: 191KB (weapon bob + sound wiring + armor system)
- Monster damage now routes through `player_take_damage()` instead of directly modifying `player_health`

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Ammo consumption** — firing deducts ammo for current weapon. Pistol/chaingun use bullets (1), shotgun uses shells (1), rocket uses rockets (1), plasma uses cells (1). Fist and chainsaw are free. Empty weapon refuses to fire.
- **Hitscan shooting** — fire key traces ray from player in facing direction. Finds nearest shootable thing within weapon range (2048 units, 64 for melee). Damage: pistol 5-15, shotgun 3x(5-15), rocket 20-120, fist/chainsaw 2-20. Calls `thing_damage()` on hit → pain/death states.
- **Death and respawn** — when `player_health <= 0`: render scene with dark red tint (COLORMAP level 24), display HUD showing 0% health, wait for any key, then restart current map via `load_map()`.
- **Key cards** — `player_keys` bitmask tracks blue/yellow/red key pickups. Door specials 26/27/28 check for matching key before opening. Keys displayed in HUD status bar (STKEYS0/1/2 patches at x=239). Key pickup tracked via `things_check_pickups()`.
- **`framebuf_get_pixel()`** — read pixel from framebuffer for post-processing (death screen tint).
- **`player_try_fire()`** — ammo check + deduction, returns 1 if fire allowed.
- **`player_hitscan()`** — ray trace against all active shootable things with dot/cross product aiming.
- **`thing_radius()` accessor** — reads thing radius from runtime struct for hitscan hit detection.

### Changed

- Binary size: 190KB (gameplay mechanics + hitscan + death screen)
- Monster damage to player was already wired in v0.21.0; now has death consequence

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **DOOM-accurate lighting** — replaced linear distance dimming with proper `scalelight[16][48]` wall lighting table and `zlight[16][128]` floor/ceiling lighting table, matching R_InitLightTables() from the DOOM source. Non-linear brightness curve based on inverse distance (scale). Fake contrast verified correct (horizontal walls lightnum--, vertical lightnum++).
- **Animated wall textures** — SLADRIP1/2/3 wall texture sequence cycles every 8 ticks (same mechanism as flat animation). Extensible to full registered/commercial texture sequences.
- **Masked midtextures** — transparent middle textures on two-sided linedefs rendered as deferred drawsegs after walls/flats, before sprites. Clipped to opening between front and back sector heights. Palette index 0 treated as transparent.
- **Intermission screen** — shown after level exit with kill%, item%, secret%, time. Uses WAD patches: WIMAP0 episode background, WINUM0-9 digits, WIPCNT percent sign, WICOLON, WITIME, WIOSTK/WIOSTI/WIOSTS labels, WIF "Finished", WIENTER "Entering". Stats tracked during gameplay via `level_add_kill/item/secret/tick_time`.
- **Level stat tracking** — `level_kills`, `level_items`, `level_secrets`, `level_time` counters. Max counts derived from thing categories and sector type 9 (secret sectors).

### Changed

- Stdlib deps expanded: vec, str, syscalls added to cyrius.toml [deps]
- Binary size: 185KB (lighting tables + masked seg system + intermission)
- Seg offset sign-extended at load time (map.cyr) for correct texture mapping

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Dependency management** — added `[deps]` section to `cyrius.toml` for auto-resolve via `cyrius deps`. Stdlib modules (string, alloc, fmt, io, args, sakshi, audio) are now declared and auto-included by the build tool. Removed 24 unused vendored stdlib modules from `lib/`.
- **sakshi upgraded** — 0.5.0 to 0.9.0 (constants migrated from var to enum, expanded error handling)
- **stdlib refreshed** — string.cyr gains `atoi()`, `strstr()`; io.cyr gains file locking; all modules synced to Cyrius 3.10.1
- **Manual includes removed** — `include "lib/..."` lines in `main.cyr` replaced by auto-include from `cyrius.toml` deps declaration
- **60+ constants migrated var to enum** — ThingType, ThingState, ThingCat, ThingLayout, ThingFlags, MonsterConst, MenuScreen, SoundConst, plus removal of 5 unused FIXED_* vars. Saves ~60 gvar_toks slots.
- **Multi-return** — `render_transform_vertex()` now uses native `return (tx, ty)` with destructuring at call sites, eliminating output pointer parameters (v3.7.2 feature)
- **Switch/case blocks** — door state machine (`doors_tick`), linedef special dispatch (`doors_use`, `doors_walk_trigger`) refactored from if-chains to switch/case blocks (v3.7.4 feature). Note: case labels require literal integers, not enum identifiers.
- Minimum Cyrius version: 3.10.1 (auto-include, undefined function diagnostic)
- Binary size: 154KB (weapon/sprite animation + animated flats)

### Added

- **WAD-native menu system** — title screen (TITLEPIC fullscreen), main menu (M_DOOM logo, M_NGAME/M_OPTION/M_LOADG/M_SAVEG/M_QUITG items), skill select (M_NEWG/M_SKILL headings, M_JKILL/M_ROUGH/M_HURT/M_ULTRA/M_NMARE items), animated M_SKULL1/M_SKULL2 cursor. Replaces procedural block-letter text rendering.
- **Menu integration in game loop** — interactive mode shows title -> main menu -> skill select before game. Direct map argument (`E1M3`) skips menu. `--ppm-menu` flag renders title/menu/skill as PPM screenshots.
- **`menu_draw_lump()`** — generic WAD patch drawer for menu graphics, supports up to 128KB patches (for TITLEPIC at 68KB)
- **Weapon switching** — number keys 1-7 switch weapons (fist, pistol, shotgun, chaingun, rocket, chainsaw, plasma). Checks `player_weapons` bitmask for ownership. Fixed weapon pickup bitmask to use `1<<N` consistently.
- **Firing animation** — fire key (F) cycles weapon through sprite frames (B0, C0, D0... back to A0). 2-tick frame rate. Each weapon has correct frame count (pistol=5, shotgun=4, chaingun=2, etc.).
- **Sprite frame animation** — things cycle sprite frames based on AI state. Walk cycle (A-B), attack (C-D), pain (E-F), death (H-K), corpse (L). Sprite renderer reads frame from runtime thing struct. `sprite_find_frame()` resolves type+rotation+frame to WAD lump.
- **Runtime thing rendering** — sprite renderer now iterates runtime `things[]` array instead of raw map data, enabling animated frames and proper active/inactive state tracking.
- **Animated flats** — NUKAGE1/2/3 flat textures cycle every 8 game ticks (rotating pixel data in cache). Extensible to FWATER/BLOOD/LAVA when full WAD is available.

### Fixed

- **Sight check arithmetic shift bug** — `thing_check_sight()` used bare `>>` on signed coordinates (dx, dy, differences). Replaced with `asr()` for correct sign-preserving shifts. Previously caused incorrect line-of-sight calculations at negative coordinates.
- **Missing function `status_draw_digit`** — `menu_draw_char()` called undefined `status_draw_digit()`; replaced with existing `st_draw_small_num()`. Caught by Cyrius 3.10.0 undefined function diagnostic.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **audio.cyr** — WAD sound effect loading and ALSA playback via stdlib `lib/audio.cyr`

- **HUD layout** — repositioned all elements to match original DOOM proportions (ammo, health, arms, face, armor, keys, totals)
- **Status bar background** — dark grey (palette 104) instead of black
- **Doomguy face** — loads actual STFST sprite from WAD with health-based frame selection (5 damage levels + dead)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed (Audit Quick Wins)

- **Fake contrast** — reversed to match original DOOM: E-W walls (same Y) darkened, N-S walls (same X) brightened. ±1 COLORMAP level = ±16 light units
- **Light level scale** — changed from `>> 3` to `>> 4` for correct 16 distinct sector light levels (×2 for even colormap indexing, matching DOOM quirk)
- **Texture pegging** — `ML_DONTPEGTOP` and `ML_DONTPEGBOTTOM` flags now applied to upper/lower texture Y offsets. Door frames and window sills align correctly

- Things: 29 monsters, 67 items, 38 decorations
- Status bar HUD, sound system, menu system

### Changed

- Binary size: 107KB (down from 108KB despite adding features — dead code removal)
- Frame render time: **22ms** (was ~5 seconds — patch cache + span optimization)
- Runs at full 35Hz framerate within tick budget (28ms)
- Requires cyrius 2.4.0+ (expanded gvar_toks to 1024)
- Compile time: 79ms
- Source: 3,905 lines across 16 files

### Fixed

- `tick_count` → `tick_get_count()` (packed state)
- Menu input refs → function accessors
- Cleaned up main.cyr (removed debug prints, tightened structure)

- BSP sector lookup for per-sprite floor height and light level
- Dedicated 16KB sprite patch buffer (avoids shared WAD lump buffer corruption)
- COLORMAP shading on sprites with distance falloff

### Fixed

- Shared WAD lump buffer crash: sprites calling `wad_read_lump` in a loop overwrote previous patch data — now uses `wad_read_lump_into` with dedicated buffer
- Removed `elif` usage (not supported by all cc2 versions) — replaced with data-driven lookup table

### Changed

- Binary size: 81KB (was 74KB — sprite system adds 7KB)

- Distance-based light dimming on floor/ceiling planes

### Changed

- Binary size: 74KB (was 70KB — floor/ceiling rendering adds 4KB)
- Floor/ceiling now show actual DOOM flat textures (FLOOR4_8, etc.) instead of solid colors
- Rendering time increased (per-pixel flat calculation) but produces correct perspective

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **texture.cyr** — Wall texture loading from WAD (PNAMES, TEXTURE1, patch compositing)
- Patch-based column rendering: reads DOOM's column-major patch format (posts with transparency)
- Texture name lookup via hash table for fast sidedef → texture resolution

- Palette double-allocation: `framebuf_set_palette` and `framebuf_init` both allocated palette buffer, second one overwrote loaded data with zeros
- `sign_extend_16` rewritten to use subtraction (`lo - 0x10000`) instead of OR with bitmask

### Changed

- Binary size: 70KB (was 63KB — texture system adds 7KB)
- Wall rendering: textured columns (STARTAN3, LITE3, DOOR3, etc.) instead of solid colors
- E1M1 renders with actual DOOM wall textures, COLORMAP lighting, distance shading

- Log output format: `[timestamp_ns] [LEVEL] message`

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
